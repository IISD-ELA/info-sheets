<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>
<h3 id="background-of-the-dataset">Background of the Dataset</h3>
<p>Ice phenology refers to the duration of ice cover on a seasonally
ice-covered lake. The longest and most continuous (1969 – present)
record of ice phenology at the IISD Experimental Lakes Area (IISD-ELA),
is from Lake 239 (also called “Rawson Lake”).</p>
<p>Historically, it has been very important for individuals to be
present at IISD-ELA during the two “shoulder seasons” (spring ice-off
and fall ice-on) to collect visual ice observations of Lake 239. In
those shoulder seasons, the population of the field station typically
numbered between 1 to 4 persons, so we are indebted to the care taken by
those personnel.</p>
<p>In more recent years, newer methods (trail cameras and satellite
imagery) have been used, and other IISD-ELA lakes besides Lake 239 have
been surveyed to collect data for ice-on and ice-off dates on an ad hoc
basis. IISD-ELA continues to explore ways to grow this dataset into the
future.</p>
<h3 id="lake-size-vs-ice-phenology-relationship">Lake Size vs. Ice
Phenology Relationship</h3>
<p>Historically, Lake 239 ice phenology records served as a qualitative
index of the ice-on or ice-off dates for other regional lakes. More
recently, Higgins et al. (2021) evaluated the role of climate and lake
size in regulating ice phenology in the IISD-ELA region. They found that
lake size plays an important role in the timing of ice-on and ice-off
dates and the total duration of ice-cover. In general, as lake size
increases ice-on dates occur later due to the larger heat budgets and
longer time required for the lakes to cool. During the spring, ice-off
dates also occur later as lake size increases even for lakes near each
other. This appears to occur because the larger fetch of large lakes
increases the over lake wind speeds and ‘pushes’ snow to the ‘downwind’
edges of the lake. Snow is an excellent insulator, and the reduced snow
cover on larger lakes leads to the development of thicker ice that takes
longer to melt in the spring.</p>
<p>Overall, for lakes with surface areas between 0.2 – 10 km<sup>2</sup>
(20 – 1000 ha) the difference in ice-on dates is, on average, 30 to 45
days (i.e. the largest lakes become ice-covered 30-45 days after the
smallest lakes). During the spring, the difference is smaller with the
ice-off dates for the largest lakes occurring, on average, 10-21 days
after ice-off on the smallest lakes. Overall, the difference in the
duration of ice-cover is, on average, 22-38 days across the range in
lake size.</p>
<p>For information on the size, depth, and volume of Lake 239 and other
nearby lakes, please consult the most recent version of our IISD-ELA
bathymetry data package: <a href="https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/revisionbrowse?scope=edi&amp;identifier=1276">https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/revisionbrowse?scope=edi&amp;identifier=1276</a>
(as of writing, IISD Experimental Lakes Area 2025).</p>
<h3 id="significance-to-iisd-ela-and-research-applications">Significance
to IISD-ELA, and Research Applications</h3>
<p>A quantitative understanding of ice-phenology at the ELA has proved
useful. Logistically, spring sampling occurs as soon as possible after
ice-off so visual observations of ice-break up and communication to
offsite staff, including LTER staff and research, has served a very
practical and immediate purpose.</p>
<p>Given the strong role of air temperature in modulating ice-on and
ice-off dates, changes in ice-phenology over time (e.g. decadal or
longer) is a quantitative indicator of climate change. As noted by
Higgins et al. (2021) over the 1970-2019 period the duration of
ice-cover on L239 has declined by c. 4 days per decade, or approximately
3 weeks over the 50+ year period.</p>
<p>The duration of the ice-free period also has implications for lake
heating, the timing of stratification, gas exchange and annual
evaporation. These may be important considerations for other research on
seasonally ice-covered lakes.</p>
<h3 id="predicting-ice-on-and-ice-off">Predicting Ice-on and
Ice-off</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In my opinion, it doesn’t matter how cold the winter was or how
thick the ice. The only thing that matters is the weather in the last
two weeks of April.”</em></p>
<p>- Barney Lamm, Ball Lake Lodge founder (Lake of the Woods News
2000)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The close proximity of Lake 239 to ELA’s meteorological station has
also allowed the development of models that predict ice-on and ice-off
events based on air temperature. The models align closely with the quote
of Barney Lamm (above) who predicted that ice-off dates on Lake 239 have
been primarily driven by ‘recent’ air temperatures. In general, the
ice-off date has generally occurred between 24 – 27 days after the
31-day running average of air temperature rose above 0 degrees
Celsius.</p>
<p>More recently, IISD-ELA have combined long-term ice phenology data
with meteorology and limnology datasets to predict ice-off using machine
learning. A model was developed and first used to predict ice-off in
2024, with reasonably good accuracy. As of writing, it is under further
testing and development, so it has not yet been released publicly.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<h3 id="method-codes">Method Codes</h3>
<p>It is worth noting that, at this time, there is no global standard
for defining ice phenology, so it is important for data users to read
the definitions provided with each dataset and for data providers to
remain consistent (or note any inconsistencies) in the methods used to
collect the data (Sharma et al., 2022). Therefore, we outline the two
methods we have used to determine ice-on and ice-off dates, and they are
specified for each data record with a code. The main distinction between
our two codes is the observation method: ground-based in-person (ICE1)
or via trail cameras and satellite imagery (ICE2).</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="ground-based-visual-observations-ice1">Ground-based visual
observations (ICE1)</h3>
<p>The dates for ice-on and ice-off are based on the judgement of an
observer who looks over the lake from a vantage point and estimates the
presence of ice visually. These observations generally happen more
frequently when it is observed that breakup is about to occur or that
the lake is getting close to freezing. Observations are made in the
morning after sunrise and again before sunset, by recording an estimate
of the ice cover as a percentage.</p>
<h4 id="ice-off">Ice-Off</h4>
<p>The date of &quot;ice -off&quot; is defined as being the last date on which 80%
or more of the ice has melted. The ice usually melts quickly within a
day or two once the &quot;candled&quot; ice sheet has broken up. Most often, on
the last day of ice cover, the blackened candled ice will cover the
entire lake in the morning and, over the course of the day, completely
disappear by late afternoon or early evening. This date has usually been
fairly easy to quantify. In rare cases of where the lake freezes and
thaws again, the last thaw date is taken and the alternate date is noted
in the comments.</p>
<h4 id="iceon">Ice–On</h4>
<p>The date of “ice-on” is defined as the first date where the lake is
80% or more ice covered. The precise date for ice-on is generally more
difficult to quantify than ice-off, since the formation of thin
ice-layers may be subsequently broken up by wind induced turbulence.
Considering the original use for the data, it was usually adequate to
know when the lake was “effectively ice covered” and was defined as the
first date that the ice cover had reached 80% or greater. In most years
when applicable, both the 80% and 100% dates were recorded if freezing
was gradual, however the 80% frozen date is used as the official date
for consistency. The date on which ice first appeared along shorelines
and small bays was not normally recorded. Typically, the main body of
the lake freezes over all at once in one night. However, in some years,
the lake freezes gradually, resulting in a partial ice sheet for a
varying number of days before completely freezing over. This was the
case in at least two ice-on dates (2009 and 2015) on record. The
following field notes illustrate three examples of typical
situations.</p>
<p>Field notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nov 26, 2009 L.239, no ice</li>
<li>Dec 3 &lt;50% ice cover</li>
<li>Dec 4 ~60% ice cover</li>

<li>Dec 9 AM L.239 ~95%; ice fog and heavily overcast; KB</li>

<li>This continues until Dec 20</li>
<li>Dec 20 AM L. 239 100% Ice cover – GF (from low vantage point)</li>
<li>Dec 25 L 239 first day of 100% ice cover, as verified by daily
satellite imagery.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lengthy freeze of the lake in 2015 was due to abnormally warm
weather in late November and early December. New records for maximum air
temperature were recorded at many locations in southern Manitoba on
December 9<sup>th</sup>, 2015 including Winnipeg at
+5.6<sup>o</sup>C.</p>
<h4 id="vantage-points">Vantage Points</h4>
<p>Vantage points that have been used to view the ice on Lake 239
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dock on Lake 239</li>
<li>The meteorological site</li>
<li>The top of Lake 303 ridge on the road.</li>
</ul>
<p>A high vantage point is best. It can be quite difficult to estimate
cover from a low vantage point, see example above (Dec 20, 2015).
Following the forest fire in 1980, the latter two locations offered a
good view of the lake, however in recent years the gradual increase in
tree height now obscures the view almost entirely.</p>
<p>The view from the cleared helicopter pad near the Lake 239 outflow
offers a good view of the lake but it is sometimes necessary to go to
the beaches at the NW and NE corners of the lake to be certain.
Estimating the ice coverage is easiest when a light snow cover is
present, creating a contrast to the dark open water. This was not the
case in 2015 because much of the ice was dark and unsafe to venture
on.</p>
<h3 id="trail-cameras-and-satellite-imagery-ice2">Trail cameras and
satellite imagery (ICE2)</h3>
<p>Similarly to the in-person visual observations, this method uses
criteria of 80% of the lake surface ice-covered for ice-on and 80% of
the lake surface ice-free conditions for ice-off, and accounts for
re-freeze/re-thaw situations by taking the first date for ice on and the
last date for ice off (and noting the alternate dates in the comments).
The difference is that instead of or in addition to in-person visual
observations, trail cameras are used, as well as satellite imagery in
some cases.</p>
<p>While in-person visual observations have been consistently undertaken
on Lake 239 since 1969, the trail camera method was introduced in 2016.
For Lake 239 the trail camera photos provide confirmation of the visual
observations. For other lakes, the trail camera photos are the primary
means of quantifying the ice-on and ice-off dates. Since the period of
ice-formation, ice-decay and snow cover are not binary events (i.e.
on/off) but occur over a period of time. The historical photos may be of
future use to further characterize conditions.</p>
<p>In general, the orientation of cameras is in part practical, but also
is intended to capture as much of the lake as possible or, for larger
lakes (e.g. Winnage), a large basin. In some cases, more than one camera
is used. For Lake 239, one camera is mounted facing north, at the top of
a 10 m tower located at the south end of the lake (the cleared
helicopter pad near the Lake 239 outflow). A second camera is typically
mounted about 1.5 m above the ground on a tree at the north end of the
lake, facing south. The trail camera approach was also used to validate
satellite photos of ice coverage for a series of lakes that spanned a
lake size gradient (20 – 1000 ha; Higgins et al. 2021).</p>
<p>A combination of Bushnell, Moultrie, and Reconyx brand cameras were
deployed on trees along the shorelines of the lakes (similarly to the
Lake 239 camera positions described above). Cameras typically collect
hourly photos. For larger lakes where the camera field of view included
only a small proportion of lake area (i.e., an embayment), the photos
were used to ground truth satellite imagery, which was then used to
estimate the ice-on or ice-off date of the lake.</p>
