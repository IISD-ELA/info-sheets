<h1 id="general-information-">General Information </h1>
<p>Chemistry data from the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) has been
collected across ELA lakes since May 1968. Water samples are collected
and analyzed for a variety of parameters, for both specific research
projects and long-term ecological research (LTER), and across
manipulated lakes or enclosures and reference lakes.  <br />
 <br />
The management of the chemistry dataset has periodically changed since
its inception, as would be expected with technological advances over the
years. Currently, all chemistry data undergo ETL (extract, transform,
load) from source databases into a PostgreSQL master database. This
represents a merging of older chemistry data 1968 through 2016 that were
compiled into a Microsoft Access database and newer data 2017 to present
which are managed in Sample Master (a Laboratory Information Management
System). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The way fields are named and formatted, as well as the naming of
chemical parameters, is largely based on the DataStream Open Data Schema
for Water Quality Data, which is itself based on the United States
Environmental Protection Agency’s “Water Quality eXchange” (WQX)
(DataStream 2022; United States Environmental Protection Agency 2022).
However, the names of a few chemical parameters in the internal IISD-ELA
Master Database and the Chemistry of LTER Lakes data package on the
Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) repository differ from those used in
the parallel data package on the DataStream repository. For further
details on these differences, refer to the Appendices section.</p>
<h1 id="methods-">Methods </h1>
<h2 id="sampling">Sampling</h2>
<h3 id="integrated-water-sampling">Integrated Water Sampling</h3>
<p>Integrated water samples were collected from the epilimnion and
metalimnion (when present) of LTER lakes approximately biweekly during
the open water season (c. May through October). See the
“Instrumentation” section for a diagram of the integrated sampler
used.</p>
<p>Integrated epilimnion samples (<strong>EPI</strong>) are collected
starting from the lake surface to 0.5 m above the bottom of the thermal
epilimnion, or to the depth of 1% of surface PAR when the thermal
epilimnion extends beyond this depth by at least 0.5 m. The thermal
epilimnion has stable temperature throughout, with changes in
temperature of less than 1 °C / 1 m increase in depth. The bottom of the
thermal epilimnion is defined as the shallowest depth with a stable
temperature, after which a temperature change of ≥ 0.25 °C occurs within
a 0.25 m increase in depth.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Integrated metalimnion samples (<strong>META</strong>) are collected
between the bottom of the thermal epilimnion and the depth at which 1%
of surface PAR occurs. When the thermal epilimnion extends beyond the
depth of 1% of surface PAR, no integrated metalimnion sample is
collected. When taking a META sample, the inlet tube is closed off using
the clamping mechanism before entering the water and later opened via a
messenger weight when at the proper depth. In this way, epilimnetic
water is not inadvertently sampled as the sampler descends to the proper
sampling depth of the metalimnion. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="profile-sampling-">Profile Sampling </h3>
<p>Water chemistry profile sampling involves taking samples of the water
column at pre-determined depths (e.g. Lake 239 depths are 1, 5, 10, 15,
20, 25, 30 m). Note that if an integrated epilimnion sample was
collected at the same time as the profile samples (and usually this is
the case, for IISD-ELA data), additional profile samples within the
epilimnion are not collected as well. Profile samples within the
epilimnion range would be essentially a repeat sample of the same water
as the integrated epilimnion sample, since the epilimnion is well mixed
and homogeneous, at least in terms of chemistry. This was tested
historically and generally holds true, except on very calm (non-windy)
days. It saves a lot on chemistry costs and effort for IISD-ELA.</p>
<p>So for example, if you are looking to use profile data from 239 and
see the depths only begin at 5 m (missing a 1 m sample), it means you
will need to also use the integrated epilimnion data to represent the
first layer within the profile data.</p>
<p>Water is pumped from depth using a marked sampling line (Kuri Tec
KLEARON food grade PVC tubing: 1/4'” inner diameter, 3/8” outer diameter
for the marked line and 3/16” inner diameter, 5/16” outer diameter to
connect the line to the pump), and a 24v Greylor gear pump (part number:
001-240103 - 24V, HDPE Gears, Heat Sink w/No Holes, Viton Seal). The
pump must not be run dry- the gears will melt and cause the pump to stop
working properly.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>While sampling with the pump, care is taken to ensure that the pump
does not introduce air (bubbles) to the sample. The connection between
the pump hose and the sampling line is inspected to ensure air is not
being introduced, and the out-line of the pump is also inspected for
bubbles. If bubbles are present in the out-line but not the in-line,
this indicates that the seals on the pump need to be replaced.  </p>
<p>Bottles are rinsed twice with water from the target depth before
filling, and when filling a bottle for analysis that is sensitive to air
being introduced (e.g. an oxygen bottle) the hose from the pump is
inserted to the bottom of the bottle during filling, to reduce air being
mixed into the sample. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="analysis-">Analysis </h2>
<p>Sample bottles are brought to the IISD-ELA chemistry lab on site, and
subsampled for lab analyses for a wide variety of parameters. Sometimes
samples have been shipped to other labs for certain analyses, but
increasingly analysis is done at the IISD-ELA chemistry lab. The lab
that performed analysis on a sample is indicated in the lab name column
for each record in the data. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Methods and instrumentation used to analyze samples have changed over
the decades of data in the IISD-ELA chemistry dataset. This is indicated
in the data via method name and instrument columns. Details of
laboratory procedures for each parameter are described in published
standard operating procedures—editions of The Chemical Analysis of Fresh
Water (Havens et al. 2024; Stainton et al. 1977). The year and edition
are indicated in the analytical reference column for each record in the
data. Early data have unknown processing methods. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="processing-">Processing </h2>
<p>Benchtop quality control practices are carried out as described in
the standard operating procedures. Data are entered into Sample Master
(the chemistry lab LIMS) and undergo some additional quality control
checks and corrections when traveling through the pipeline loading the
data into the IISD-ELA master database. These are checks that values are
within expected ranges, and that metadata-related columns are populated
or conform to expected values. The data are otherwise relatively “raw”
and unprocessed.</p>
<h1 id="instrumentation-">Instrumentation </h1>
<p><img src="attachments/media/image1.png" style="width:6.47591in;height:5.53797in" alt="A diagram of a machine Description automatically generated" /> </p>
<p>This is the original Integrated Sampler design (Shearer 1978), used
for integrated water samples. The overall design has remained largely
unchanged since its inception. The sample bottle is now a ~2 L Nalgene
bottle encased and insulated within a large PVC shell, and the
weight/bottle holder is constructed of a single piece of a solid
stainless steel. The frame with the clamping mechanism clips into the
weight/bottle holder with small metal clips, rather than wing-nuts. </p>

approaches to assessing the detection limits (e.g. half the limit,
normal distribution of the detection limit), but we cannot be
proscriptive for how individuals use our data. For earlier years of data

<h2 id="result-detection-limits">Result Detection Limits</h2>
<p>The result detection limit values
(result_detection_quantitation_limit_measure) from 2017 to present were
calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initially average detection limits were calculated and applied as
annual averages per parameter (characteristic_name), but these were all
changed-over to be detection limits per run, by the end of 2024. Given
the finer scale of analytical run detection limits, the data user can
average per year or summarize whichever way they deem fit.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether a result value is above or below detection is determined
at the time of data entry. If the result is below detection, typically
the result_value is entered as 0, but sometimes the actual (below
detection) value is noted instead. <strong>It is up to the data user to
examine the result_value vs. detection limit and decide how they will
handle below detection records.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A description of how the detection limit is calculated is
described in the third edition of The Chemical Analysis of Freshwater
(Havens et al. 2024). It is calculated for each run by using equations 1
through 3:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Equation 1.          <span class="math inline">\(C_{dl} = \
\frac{y_{d} - b}{m}\)</span></p>
<p>where <em>b</em> is the y-intercept, <em>m</em> is the slope, and
<em>y<sub>d</sub></em> is the signal detection limit, which is
calculated using equation 2:</p>
<p>Equation. 2.         <span class="math inline">\(y_{d} = 3s_{y} +
b\)</span></p>
<p>where <em>s<sub>y</sub></em> is the residuals between the measured
signal for each standard concentration and the calibration curve
predicted response for each standard concentration and is calculated
using equation 3:</p>
<p>Equation 3.          <span class="math inline">\(s_{y} = \
\sqrt{\frac{?_{}^{}{di}^{2}}{n - 2}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <em>n</em> is the number of standards in the calibration curve,
and <em>di</em> is the difference between the measured signal for each
standard concentration and the calibration curve predicted response for
each standard concentration.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="quality-control-levels">Quality Control Levels</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Preliminary: Samples that have passed the analytical quality
control parameters (samples that failed are not entered into the
database). Quality control parameters for each analysis are available in
the third edition of The Chemical Analysis of Fresh Water (Havens et al.
2024). This step is benchmark quality control (e.g., blanks, duplicates,
etc.). Internally this corresponds with level result_status_id 1 in
Sample Master and “Entered”.</p></li>
<li><p>Accepted: Samples that have undergone a second level of quality
control. That is, records that have passed trend analysis. Trend
analysis is conducted for each parameter at each site to look for
outliers and then investigate the outliers. This step is done internally
using an R script for efficiency. For more information, see the third
edition of The Chemical Analysis of Fresh Water (Havens et al. 2024).
Internally this corresponds with level result_status_id 2 in Sample
Master and “Validated”.</p></li>
<li><p>Final: Samples that have undergone external peer-review.
Currently IISD-ELA has not yet defined a process to evaluate whether a
record has been peer-reviewed, but there are plans to do this and use
this designation in the future. Internally this corresponds with level
result_status_id 3 in Sample Master and “Approved”.</p></li>
<li><p>Not noted or null: Quality control level is not noted for all
pre-2017 records. For 2017 to present, records with result_status_id 0
or null are not written to the database, as the result value has not
been entered yet (though other parameters for a record may be filled out
ahead of time in Sample Master).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chemical-parameter-names-on-edi-and-datastream">Chemical
Parameter Names on EDI and DataStream</h2>
<p>Following a discussion in early 2025 between DataStream staff and
IISD-ELA’s data team and research chemist, the names of chemical
parameters in both the IISD-ELA master database and the Chemistry of
LTER Lakes data package on EDI were revised to better align with those
used in the parallel DataStream data package (see table below). However,
we decided to keep some differences.</p>
<p>The result sample fractions for “PARTC” and “PARTFE” were labeled as
“Suspended” across EDI, the IISD-ELA master database, and DataStream,
following DataStream’s guidance for non-nutrient parameters. However, we
thought the “Suspended” label may cause confusion since these
measurements actually refer to particles retained on a filter. To
address this, the parameter names on EDI and in the IISD-ELA master
database are “particulate,” but it is “suspended” on DataStream (their
standards must be followed for the data upload to be accepted for their
repository). A similar clarification was made for “PARTN” and “PARTP”,
although their result sample fraction labels already make this
clear.</p>
<p>In the EDI data package and the IISD-ELA master database, each
chemical parameter has a unique name in the characteristic columns. In
contrast, on DataStream, parameters are distinguished by unique
combinations of CharacteristicName, MethodSpeciation, and
ResultSampleFraction. For example, our “Nitrogen, particulate” and
“Total dissolved nitrogen” are both labeled as “Total Nitrogen, mixed
forms” on DataStream, but are differentiated by their
ResultSampleFraction values: “Non-Filterable (Particle)” and “Filtered,”
respectively. Therefore, it is important to consider all three columns
when interpreting the DataStream data package.</p>

website (DataStream 2025) and to <em>The Chemical Analysis of Fresh
Water</em> (Havens et al. 2024).</p>
