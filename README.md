# IISD-ELA Info Sheets

Welcome! This repository holds Info Sheets for most IISD-ELA datasets. Info Sheets are our user-friendly way to communicate metadata, to ensure our datasets are well understood and intepreted correctly. Each Info Sheet includes:
- Background about the datasets
- Methods (sampling, analysis, and any data processing)
- Data table structuring and data dictionaries (definitions for each column in the data tables)
- Additional information and references

Clicking a link below will bring you to the respective infosheet, otherwise feel free to use the directory to navigate. This repository is in active development, so if you are looking for an info sheet that isn't available here yet, please contact us at eladata@iisd-ela.org.
