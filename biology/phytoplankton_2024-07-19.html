<h2 id="general-background">General Background</h2>
<p>Phytoplankton data have been collected from various lakes at the IISD
Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), in Northwestern Ontario Canada since
1969. The collection of phytoplankton samples was undertaken as part of
ELA’s Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) program.</p>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<h3 id="sampling">Sampling</h3>
<p>Integrated water samples were collected from the epilimnion and
metalimnion (when present) of LTER lakes approximately biweekly during
the open water season (c. May through October). The epilimnion was
defined as the upper surface layer, which extended from the air-water
interface to the thermocline. The metalimnion was operationally defined
as extending from the thermocline to the bottom of the euphotic zone (1%
surface irradiance). The samples were collected in opaque and insulated
sampling bottles as described by Shearer (1978). Subsamples (c. 125 mL)
were taken and preserved with Lugol’s solution and stored in the dark at
room temperature until analysis.</p>
<p>A 2 mL aliquot was gravity settled for 24 hours and species
identification and enumeration were undertaken at 125X and 550X using
the Utermol method (Nauwerek 1963). Cell measurements were undertaken on
each species to maximum of 50 individuals, and cell numbers were then
converted to wet weight biomass by estimating cell volumes of each
species by fitting cell shapes to geometric formulae and assuming a
specific gravity of 1.0 (Vollenweider 1968).</p>
<h3 id="processing">Processing</h3>
<p>Sample data were stored in their raw form within the 'Tabular Data -
Phytoplankton Species Abundance, Biomass and Cell Volume' table. The
summarized abundance and biomass within each sample were calculated for
7 taxonomic groups by summing values within each taxonomic grouping. The
first number within each species code represents the taxonomic group (1=
cyanophyte, 2= chlorophyte, 3= euglenophyte, 4= chrysophyte, 5= diatom,
6= cryptophyte, 7= dinoflagellate). Total abundance and total biomass
values provided in the 'Tabular Data - Phytoplankton Group Biomass and
Total Biomass' table were calculated by summing values across all
taxonomic groups for each sample.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>area_catchment</td>
<td>numerical</td>
<td>kilometers squared</td>
<td>Area of the terrestrial catchment associated with the specified
monitoring_location_name. This is the watershed area, not including the
lake itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>area_surface</td>
<td>numerical</td>
<td>meters squared</td>
<td>The surface area of the lake associated with the specified
monitoring_location_name. The area excludes islands and protruding
boulders (where survey methods differentiated). Values are calculated to
0.01 metres squared, but the error would be greater than 1 (in most
cases the DEM used to calculate the area has 1 metre resolution). The
area is calculated from a geospatial polygon produced from a combination
of satellite imagery tracing and transects on the lake.</td>

characteristic and value in question. For example, in a depth range of
2.5 to 5.0 metres deep, the lower depth is 5.0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>depth_max</td>
<td>numerical</td>
<td>meters</td>
<td>The maximum depth of the lake associated with the specified
monitoring_locaiton_name. That is, the depth at the deepest point on the
day of survey. The value is calculated from a GIS raster DEM, produced
using sonar data from transects across the lake and using satellite
imagery to trace its extent. Values are calculated to 0.01 metres,
corresponding in most cases with raw sonar readings provided to 0.01
metres, but the degree of error would be greater.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>depth_mean</td>
<td>numerical</td>
<td>meters</td>
<td>The mean (average) depth of the lake associated with the specified
monitoring_location_name. The value is calculated from a GIS raster DEM,
so is based on the depth values across the entire lake. The DEM was
produced using sonar data from transects across the lake, and using
satellite imagery to trace its extent. Values are calculated to 0.01
metres, corresponding in most cases with raw sonar readings provided to
0.01 metres, but the degree of error would be greater.</td>

<tr>
<td>mixing_status</td>
<td>categorical</td>

<td>Lakes at the ELA research facility are usually defined as ‘dimictic’
or ‘polymictic’. The vertical water column of dimictic lakes mix
partially or completely twice each year (typically in spring after
ice-out and in late autumn prior to complete ice formation).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>monitoring_ location_name</td>
<td>text</td>
<td>n/a</td>
<td>Name of sampled or surveyed geographic location at the IISD
Experimental Lakes Area field site. The name consists of: <location> or
<location sublocation> or <location sublocation station>. Location is
typically the lake number (each lake is named with a number,
representing the lake's geographical watershed), sublocation typically
specifies LA for "lake" (or a basin, e.g. NB - north basin, or other),
and station is usually CB ("centre buoy" - at about the deepest point of
the lake). Some names do not have all three parts since a broader area
is in question (e.g. for bathymetry, the entire lake, not just the
centre buoy).</td>

<tr>
<td>order</td>

<td>n/a</td>
<td>taxonomic unit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>order_lake</td>
<td>categorical</td>
<td>n/a</td>
<td>The position of the lake within the drainage network. First order
lakes (lake_order=1) are headwater lakes, second order lakes
(lake_order= 2) receive surface water inflows from 1 upstream lake,
etc.</td>
