A dataset is a collection of data to which several individual data records (rows) belong. Dataset names are useful to distinguish groups of data across different research fields and provide some descriptive context.

Blank or null means no, the fish is not dead, the fish is alive, and Y means yes, the fish is dead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The name consists of: <location> or <location sublocation> or <location sublocation station>. Location is typically the lake number (each lake is named with a number, representing the lake's geographical watershed), sublocation which typically specifies LA for "lake" (or a basin, e.g. NB - north basin, or other), and station which is usually CB ("centre buoy" - at about the deepest point of the lake). Some names do not have all three parts since a broader area is in question (e.g. for bathymetry, the entire lake, not just the centre buoy). |
