**General**

Relative humidity is the ratio of the amount of moisture in a given space to the amount the space could contain if saturated, expressed as a percentage. These data were collected, along with air temperature, to calculate the actual vapour pressure tern in empirical evaporation equations that only required mean daily or mean monthly values. Measuring devices, methods and data resolution have improved over time as better equipment and computing technology became available. This progression has evolved from manual sling psychrometers, wet/dry bulb hygrometers, chart recorders that employ a hygroscopic hair element to modern digital data loggers and sensors having greater sensitivity and resolution. Instrumentation was located in a Stevenson screen shelter.

The IISD-ELA database contains logged hourly relative humidity data starting 1 January 2007. Data up to the end of 1987 was published in Beaty 1981, Beaty 1984 and Beaty and Lyng 1989, and is not currently in the IISD-ELA database.

# Site Location

The site is land based and is located 370 m west of Rawson Lake (L239), 400 m northwest of the field station, and 43 m above the lake surface.

# Collection Methods

<u>Past methods</u>

Collection of relative humidity data at the ELA met site began in May 1970. In that first year, values reported were the average of readings taken from a wet/dry bulb hygrometer twice daily at 08:00 and 19:00 CST. In 1971, values from May 11 to June 6 were based on the average of readings taken at 07:00 and 12:00 CST. Mean daily values from June 7 to the end of the season in 1992 were determined by hand scaling weekly charts from a Casella London recording thermohygrograph. All original charts are on file at IISD-ELA storage. Routine checks were made using either a sling psychrometers or a ventilated hygrometer to verify the reliability of the recorder.

<u>Instrumentation</u>

In January 1993, a Campbell Scientific 21X data logger was installed by Environment Canada at the met site which included a sensor for relative humidity. The raw data files provide average hourly values. The loggers were upgraded to a CS-23X on August 5, 2009 and to a CR3000 on November 2, 2011. These loggers, sensors, and data belong to and have been maintained by Environment Canada.

On July 31, 2007, a Campbell Scientific CR1000 data logger owned by IISD-ELA was installed at the met site which collected hourly relative humidity data, along with other parameters.

The following section is meant to document data contained in the IISD-ELA database. See above for a description of data prior to 1 January 2007.

**These codes are used in the IISD-ELA database in the Collection Methods field.**

As of September 2017, there is no retrieval query for relative humidity in the retriever, it is unclear if humidity data made it into the new database. This section assumes it is there, just not retrievable.

> LM1 – Digital relative humidity data up to 5 August 2009. Logged hourly data was captured on the CS-21X logger using a Vaisala HMP 35A.
>
> LM2 - 6 August 2009 to 2 Nov 2011. Logged hourly data captured on the CS-23X logger using a Vaisala HMP 45C temperature and relative humidity probe.
>
> LM3 - 2 November 2011 to current. Logged hourly data captured on the CR3000 datalogger (ECCC) with a Vaisala HMP 45C temperature and relative humidity probe. Data may be used to fill gaps in LM4 and LM5 data.
>
> LM4 - 31 July 2007 to 16 August 2022. Logged hourly data captured on IISD-ELA CR1000 datalogger with an HMP 45C temperature and relative humidity probe (6-wire).
>
> LM5 – 16 August 2020 to current. Logged data captured on IISD-ELA CR1000 datalogger with a HygroVUE 10 temperature and humidity sensor. This data is the primary source of RH data since deployment. This data may also be used to fill gaps in the LM3 data.
