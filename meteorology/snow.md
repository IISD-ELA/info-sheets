## General Information

This information sheet provides an overview of quantitative snow records collected at ELA since June 27, 1969 when the meteorological site was installed and records began. Four types of snowfall records that have been collected since then:
- Snow water equivalent
- Depth of fresh fallen snow
- Snowpack (this is currently the only data table available from the IISD-ELA master database)
- Snow surveys

Environment Canada public data for IISD Experimental Lakes Area found below:
Rawson Lake (AUT): <https://tinyurl.com/ELAmetsite>

Measurements of daily water equivalent, fresh fallen snow depth, and snowpack accumulation have been collected at the meteorological site according to Environment Canada protocols. Winter snow surveys were carried out in most years at specific snow courses throughout the Rawson Lake Watershed (393 ha). The snow courses were selected to be representative within the basin at high, medium and low elevations relative to the lake surface. The meteorological site is a medium elevation and exposure site located approximately 0.5 km NW of the field station and about 75 – 100 m off the Pine Road.

## Methods

### Site Location

The IISD-ELA meteorological station ("METSITE" in the data tables) is land based and is located 370 m west of Rawson Lake (L239), 400 m northwest of the field station, and 43 m above the lake surface. Altitude above sea level is 433m.

### Daily snow water equivalent

A Nipher Shielded Snow Gauge was installed as part of the instrumentation array deployed in June 1969 by the Meteorological Branch of the Department of Transport (now Atmospheric Services, Environment Canada). The same gauge has been in use since that time and all collections have been carried out according to Environment Canada protocol. The gauge consists of an aluminum wind deflector shield and an inner copper collection canister. The gauge has been in service from the late fall until early spring to capture the snow season in every year. Daily service has been carried out each morning in the following manner. On each visit, the site operator inspects the gauge and if precipitation has occurred in the past 24 hours, the canister is removed and exchanged with a clean one. The canister containing sample is melted and measured in a specific graduate calibrated to the collection surface area to read directly as point depth in millimetres similar to how rainfall is measured in a rain gauge. Special attention is given to brush away snow that may have accumulated directly on the rim of the shield. In the case of mixed rain and snow events, the operator has attempted to determine the quantities of each type if possible. This data has been recorded in the original site measurement field notebooks (series “C”), in monthly climatological station reports and is incorporated in the electronic data base as daily precipitation.

### Depth of fresh snowfall

In most years, the depth of fresh fallen snow has been measured on a snow board located near the Nipher Snow Gauge. The snow board is an elevated table-top platform 0.3 m above the ground and 1.3 m square. It is painted white and equipped with a broom and a snow ruler. Each morning, in conjunction with the Nipher gauge service, the depth of fresh snow is measured, recorded in centimetres and then swept clean. If the accumulation had been affected by wind, the observation is duly noted or disregarded. This data provides an understanding of the ratio of fresh snow to water equivalent for the ELA region and is sometimes useful for estimating water equivalent should the gauge value be corrupted or in question.

### Snowpack

The accumulation of snow on the ground within the basin is referred to as “snowpack”. In most years, accumulated snow depth, in centimetres, has been measured almost daily and after major snowfalls since November 1969. This data has been recorded in the original site measurement field notebooks (series “C”), in monthly climatological station reports and is incorporated in the ELA electronic data base. This data set is important for defining the “snow season” and the timing and depth of the peak snowpack each year. Notes relevant to this data set are as follows.

1)  Measurements of accumulated snow depth were taken at the meteorological site usually at the time of the routine morning observations.  
2)  Observations were made almost daily and after major snowfalls.  
3)  In the spring, snow may be deeper or more extensive in the forest or low-lying areas than implied by the measurement observed at the meteorological site.  
4)  Generally, snow disappeared from ridge tops, south facing slopes and lake surfaces earlier than other areas.  
5)  The snow depth observed at the meteorological station may not be indicative of snow depth or density conditions on a frozen lake surface where snow is subject to higher wind and often the presence of water and slush between the snow and ice surfaces. Consult the IISD-ELA ice thickness dataset for lake snow measurements, when available.



### Snow depth collection methods

SR1 - method code; several readings (usually 10) were taken with a snow ruler at random or fixed locations around the meteorological site to the nearest whole centimetre and averaged.

In addition, Environment Canada has operated a Campbell Scientific data logger at the meteorological site to monitor climatological parameters since January 1993. On August 5, 2009, EC upgraded from a CS-21X to a CS-23X logger with the addition of a snow depth sensor. The EC datalogger was upgraded to a CR3000 on November 2, 2011, and the snow sensor upgraded to a SR50-45. While this data only provides a single point location, it is a continuous hourly data set. This data has not been incorporated in the ELA data base.

### Snow surveys

Snow Surveys were routinely carried out once or twice each year since the winter of 1969/70. Surveys, however, were less frequent between the years 2010 and 2020 due to staffing and other complicating issues during the period of uncertainty and transition from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to the International Institute of Sustainable Development (April 2014).

The snow survey provides fundamental hydrologic information used to calculate an estimate of water available for spring runoff prior to the melt. The data from a comprehensive snow survey include snow depth, water content and density for a whole watershed. Together, data for water available, precipitation and stream flow are used to calculate basin runoff yield. Snow surveys at the ELA have primarily been carried out only in the Rawson Lake Watershed and may be extrapolated to other sites when useful. Surveys were generally conducted in late February to mid-March to define the peak snowpack and snow condition before ripening occurred. The data also provides a check on the accumulated Nipher snow gauge values collected over the winter. As winter progresses, the snowpack settles and ages. This process from a fine to a coarse crystalline state is known as ripening (Bruce and Clark 1966). In the ELA region, the density of fresh fallen snow usually ranges from 0.07 to 0.15 with an average of about 0.10. By late February, the snow density is usually fairly consistent in the 0.2 range. The density of a ripe snowpack generally ranges between 0.3 and 0.6. Snow density is the ratio of water equivalent to the depth of the snowpack (cm/cm). The water equivalent of the snowpack is the depth of water that would result from melting and is dependent on the depth and density.

<u>Two survey methods have been used at ELA:</u>

1)  Mount Rose Snow Sampler (MRSS): The MRSS consists of an aluminum coring tube with a cutting edge having an inside diameter of 1.485 inches (3.77 cm), so that a core weighing one ounce (28.35 g) is equivalent to one inch (2.54 cm) of water. This allows for determination of snowpack water equivalents to be made gravimetrically in the field using a portable calibrated spring balance. Usually 7 to 10 sample points were selected randomly in the general area of each snow course used in the overall survey. Several snow course sites are normally used in a survey. For this method three measurements are made for each sample point: depth of the snow, weight of empty tube, and weight of the tube and sample.

2)  ELA Coring Tube Method (ELA-CTM): This method evolved out of our experiences with the MRSS. It employed a considerably larger thin walled aluminum coring tube (12.38 cm diameter; 120.31 cm<sup>2</sup> area) than the MRSS. There were two parts to the survey: first, a set of 10 cores were collected for density and water content determination at a representative site and, secondly, a basin wide survey for snow depth was carried out at several sites. The 10 cores were collected at the selected site by inserting the thin walled coring tube down to the frozen sandy soil. The snow depth was recorded for each core. Each sample was retrieved by digging around the tube with a shovel, sliding a thin metal plate under the tube, carefully lifting it and emptying the snow sample into a sturdy plastic bag. The samples were carefully transported to the laboratory, melted overnight and measured for volume the next morning. Knowing the cross-sectional area of the tube, snow depth and volume of melted snow, the water content and density could then be calculated. The second part of the survey involved a basin wide survey by visiting several other snow course sites where at least 10 measurements of snow depth were recorded for each site. The snow density from the 10 snow cores was then applied to the other sites and water content was calculated based the assumption that the snow density was uniform over the watershed.

We began our snow surveys at ELA using the MRSS and the methods recommended in the Snow Sampling Guide (U.S.D.A. 1959) and by Bruce and Clark (1966). This method was used from 1970 to 1989. In 1990, due to low snow depths and the difficulty in obtaining satisfactory cores, we began to use the second method (ELA-CTM) and found it to be better suited for ELA and the conditions we were experiencing. The MRSS is better suited for greater snow depths than we were experiencing at ELA in most winters and that the balance was somewhat awkward and lacked sensitivity to our relatively small cores. The MRSS also relies on cutting into the soil or vegetative layer to obtain a plug to retain the core in the tube during extraction. Many of the ELA sites are on bedrock such that cutting a plug was not possible. Without the plug or soil/vegetative evidence, we found it often difficult to know if the entire core was intact thereby introducing some uncertainty. Problems were also encountered with snow sticking or icing in the tube if the weather on the survey date was mild and sunny or the snow was beginning to ripen during the survey. We also found that by simplifying the survey with the second method we were able to obtain better core data and more depth observations around the basin than the MRSS method which was more time consuming because of the difficulty of obtaining good core samples. From our experience, Site 3 at the field camp was found to be an ideal site because of its uniform snow quality and flat sandy terrain that was representative of a mid-elevation watershed location. Our confidence in extrapolation of Site 3 snow density to the other sites was based on our previous surveys which show that on any given survey date there was very little variation around the basin regardless as to exposure or elevation. We found late winter densities to be very consistent if before the occurrence of ripening.

Snow course sites that have been used since 1970 are as follows. Many have not been used in recent years. All sites located on lake ice were eliminated due to presence of frequent slush ice. Sites that have proven to be most representative are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 19 and 20.

## Data dictionary

For now, this data dictionary only includes the columns in the snowpack dataset.

 **Column name (alphabetical)** | **data type** | **unit** | **definition** 
---|---|---|---
 account | character varying | N/A | Username of the IISD-ELA staffmember who added or most recently edited the data record. This may be generated through bulk loads or manually updated as records are edited individually. 
 comments | character varying | N/A | Remarks about the record or its collection. 
 dataset_code | character varying | N/A | A three character code made up of upper case letters and numbers unique for each IISD-ELA dataset. Should always start with a letter and may or may not end with a number. Used as a short consistent abbreviation for the dataset, whereas dataset_name is longer and may be changed and refined over time. 
 dataset_name | character varying | N/A | Name of the dataset. A dataset is a collection of data to which several individual data records (rows) belong. Dataset names are useful to distinguish groups of data across different research fields and provide some descriptive context. 
 date | date | N/A | The calendar or climatological day (YYYY-MM-DD) for the associated record, indicating when the observation, measurement, sample collection, or other recording method happened. All air temperature and precipitation datasets from IISD-ELA are based on the climatological day (at IISD-ELA, 8AM CST is used as the start of the climatological day) using the Meteorological Service of Canada’s definition of climatological day (see the info sheets for more information). Other datasets use regular calendar days. 
 method_sample_code | character varying | N/A | A short and unique code associated with a description of a method of sampling for data (i.e., how the physical sample was collected or measured in the field). 
 method_sample_desc | character varying | N/A | A short description of the method used to sample the data (collect or measure the data, in a field or lab environment). For more information, see the associated Info Sheet. 
 monitoring_location_name | character varying | N/A | Name of sampled or surveyed geographic location at the IISD Experimental Lakes Area field site. 
 qualifiers | character varying | N/A | Qualifier code(s) conveying specific information about the record. See the associated info sheets for more information. 
 snow_depth | numeric | cm | Depth as a vertical measurement from the ground to the surface of the accumulated snow. This may be an average or a single measure, depending on the method used (see method noted in other column and info sheet for more information). 
 update_date | date | N/A | Date as calendar day that the record in the IISD-ELA Postgres Master Database table was uploaded to the database or most recently modified. 
 version | numeric | N/A | The version number for a row of data is 1 when it is first added to a table, and increments by 1 every time the row is updated. 



## Snow depth codes

| **Qualifier code** | **Qualifier name** | **Definition** |
|----|----|----|
| FS | first snow | The annual date of the first recorded precipitation that was snow. This means that there was no snow on the ground prior to this date. |
| LS | last snow | The annual date of the final recorded precipitation that was snow. Note that this is based on the last occurrence of snowfall in the precipitation gauge in the spring, so there is often still snow remaining on the ground after this date. |
| P | patchy snow | For when the snow has a patchy distribution, instead of a consistent level, to indicate the presence of snow that is not easily measured. |
| SS | snow survey | For records that are further supported by a more comprehensive watershed wide snow survey. These surveys are typically conducted each winter around the time of peak snowpack at several locations within the Lake 239 (Rawson Lake) Watershed for determination of snow depth, density and water content. The additional snow survey data are not currently included in this data table, in the IISD-ELA master database. |
| TS | trace snow | For when there are only trace amounts of snow, meaning there was a presence of snow that was not easily measured due to the small amount. |
| TS, LS | trace snow and last snow | Both last snow and trace snow (see individual definitions). |
