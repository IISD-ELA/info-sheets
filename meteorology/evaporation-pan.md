# General

The problem of measuring and calculating evaporation and transpiration from lakes, forests and entire drainage basins is a difficult one. Methods rely on indirect measurements or empirical calculations of evaporation. Four methods of determining lake surface evaporation have been or are presently being used in hydrologic studies at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA):

1.  solving for lake evaporation as the residual term in Rawson Lake water budgets
2.  the energy budget approach
3.  empirical mass transfer techniques, and
4.  the evaporation pan

Of these four methods, the evaporation pan has probably been the most commonly used in the world (Bruce and Clark 1966).

Evaporation pans can be installed in three ways: floating on the lake, sunk in the ground, and installed on a low stand above ground. The first method more closely simulates surface temperature, wind and radiation effects, but is not practical with respect to servicing. The second is impractical because of potential problems of soil temperature, undetected leaks, wind exposure, and overgrown vegetation. Most pans are installed the third way, on a low stand above the ground in an exposed clearing.

# Collection Methods

The evaporation pan at ELA is located at the meteorological station (Station 1). It is a U.S. Weather Bureau Class A pan which was adopted as an interim international standard for the International Geophysical Year (1957-1957), is recommended by the World Meteorological Organization, and is the standard that has been used in Canadian Atmospheric Environment Services sites. The pan is serviced each day according to the protocol described in the service manual “Evaporation – Manual of Standard Procedures for Obtaining Evaporation Data, May 1978, Environment Canada, Atmospheric Environment Service”.

The Class A pan is 122 cm in diameter, 25 cm in depth and made of non-corrosive metal. It is installed in an open site on a low stand that permits free air circulation under and around the pan. Each morning, the water level in the pan is adjusted to a standard height determined by a fixed point gauge. The depth of water added or removed is added to, or subtracted from, the depth of precipitation that may have occurred, and a daily net water loss is calculated. A totalizing anemometer, installed near the pan at a height of 1m, records the wind run passing directly over the pan each day. Mean air and water temperatures were calculated from observations from maximum and minimum thermometers in the pan and in the nearby Stevenson Screen instrument shelter. This wind and temperature data can be used to correct the pan evaporation for advected energy as suggested by Kohler et al. (1955). This correction is generally quite small.

The ELA evaporation pan was serviced daily at 08:00 central standard time (CST). Therefore dates in the database are for an “evaporation day” beginning after the morning observation and ending at the time of the morning observation of the next day. For example, readings taken on July 15 are recorded as the evaporation of July 14.

The Net pan water loss for day (mm) is the amount of water added (or removed) from the pan each day plus the rainfall amount that occurred over the evaporation day. In some cases where there has been a large amount of rain, the net pan loss for the day is negative, meaning the amount of rain was greater than the evaporation for that day.

<u>Pan coefficients</u>

In order to convert evaporation pan data to lake evaporation, a conversion factor known as a pan coefficient is required. The pan coefficient is equal to the ratio of lake evaporation to pan evaporation. Several different investigators have shown that the annual pan coefficient is less than unity, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 (Hounam 1973). Our investigations at ELA using Rawson Lake water budgets from 1972 to 1976 yield an average annual pan coefficient of 0.64 for data uncorrected for advected energy, and 0.70 for corrected data (Newbury and Beaty 1977).

Monthly pan coefficients for Rawson Lake based on water budget evaporation varied from 0.30 to 1.10 (Newbury and Beaty 1977). For this reason the pan method is not recommended for weekly or monthly evaporation estimates. This is because the lake and the pan do not behave in exactly the same way throughout the open water season. The pan is small in relation to the lake and its water temperature fluctuates closely with the air temperature. The heat storage capacity of lakes is important, and evaporation is not closely related to daily solar energy received. In the fall season, large amounts of lake evaporation occur when surface temperatures are much higher than the air temperatures. The opposite takes place during the late spring, when the lake evaporation is low due to low surface temperatures.

<u>Collection method codes</u>

> EV1 – Currently used for all data.

Evaporation pan records at ELA began on June 27, 1969 and are continuing. Data resides in the main ELA data base and has also been contributed to the Environment Canada, Ontario Climate Centre, however, in 2005 EC ended their interest in this data. Observations before 1979 were made in English units (inches, <sup>o</sup> F and miles) and converted for the data base. Corrections for advected energy and pan coefficients have not been applied. The periods of observation or measurements in each case are always less than the ice-free period or open water season for Rawson Lake. This is because the pan record must be discontinued once freezing temperatures are common. While it may be assumed that evaporation from the pan and lake are low during the late October period of missing record, it is at the discretion of the user as to whether adjustments for this unaccounted period are warranted.

Pan water temperature monitoring was discontinued after the 2007 season.

Maximum and minimum air temperature data for the evaporation pan data table are climatological daily max/min values. These data were collected using method code VT1 until the end of the 2017 season. For 2018 to 2022, data were based on hourly avg max and min data using method code VT4. For 2023 and going forward, maximum and minimum daily air temperatures were collected using method code VT5, and are from 1 minute data.
