<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 658 is located along the west shore of the south basin of Winnange Lake. The boat landing is accessed via a 2.3 km trail off Pine Road, approximately 20.5 km from Highway 17. L658 is an 8.4 hectare, 1<sup>st</sup> order lake, with a watershed area of approximately 52.1 ha. L658 is a double basin lake with approximate maximum depths of 13 m and 10 m in the west and east basins, respectively.

For hydrometric purposes, the L658 watershed was considered as three separate components: a wetland sub-catchment, an upland sub-catchment, and remaining direct runoff. Areas for these three components are 8.13 ha for the wetland draining through flume, 7.7 ha for the upland draining through flume, and 27.9 ha for the remaining direct runoff. (These areas are from ‘658 areas revised Mar2004.xls’ document).

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 658 Lake Level

Hydrological work began November 16, 1999 with the survey of high-water marks, ice scour lines, and water levels of L658 and L660. Manual surveys were taken ~1-2 times per month between June 2000 and 29 May 2003. All surveys were to a benchmark of arbitrary datum 10.000 m, near the outflow of L628 into L660. On August 25, 2003, an OTT Thalimedes logger was installed to capture continuous water level data. The lake level gauge was decommissioned on October 27, 2011.

2.  Lake 658 Outflow

Flow measured using Marsh McBirney Flow-Tote flow sensor and dye slug test. Full details of control structure included in appendix at end of this document. Logged data was collected between July 9<sup>th</sup>, 2001 and October 20th, 2008, during the open-water season. Station was removed sometime after 2010. 658Q structure UTM coordinates: 15U 447000, 5509100

<u>History</u>

Studies began as part of the METAALICUS study. Initial hydrology on L660 was carried out by Ken Beaty, with additional instrumentation and hydrological data collected by USGS members involved with the study.

The first elevation reference (BM#55a) was a large spike in a 6” diameter jack pine, on the right side of the L658 outflow control structure and 6 m downstream. This benchmark was set to an arbitrary of 10.000 m. Initial water levels were surveyed in reference to this benchmark. Additional benchmarks were created at a later date in reference to this original benchmark.

A bathymetric survey was carried out by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.

***APPENDIX***:

From outflow permit letter written by KB to OMNR:

**Flow monitoring structure:** The structure that will resemble a wall of gravel contained by wood extending from bank to bank that will house a submerged smooth walled flow pipe (similar to a culvert). The pipe will be sized large enough so not to impound water in L.658. A flow meter is to be installed in the tube capable of measuring flow velocity in either direction. This main flow tube will be slightly oversized in order to allow for the insertion of smaller flow tubes within it as a way of reducing the cross sectional area as required to satisfy flow meter sensitivity. These reduction pipes will be installed and secured using a system of baffles or small inflatable inner tubes. We estimate that a main flow tube diameter of 38 cm (15 inches) is required to safely handle anticipated peak flows.

The structure would be built in two stages. First, a base of gravel bags would be built across the section measuring 2 m wide and 0.3 m high. This would serve as a base on which to build a pair of parallel wooden walls 1 m apart to house the flow pipe and contain gravel fill. The walls would be adequately secured to each other to contain the gravel. This wood and gravel wall would extend 1.2 m (3.9 ft.) above the base at the deepest point. We estimate that 25 m<sup>3</sup> (33 yards) of gravel would be required. All materials (gravel and wood) would be transported by helicopter. No machinery would be used on site. We estimate that this construction approach would require about a third of the material required for a conventional gravel dike.
