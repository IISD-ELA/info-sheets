<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 239 East Upper Weir is located halfway up the East Subbasin where the stream conveniently flows over exposed bedrock effectively dividing the subbasin into two almost equal parts. The upper basin has an area of 90.78 ha which is 53% of the East Subbasin.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

Hydrometric work at this station began August 22, 1973 when ELA staff constructed a 90<sup>o</sup> v-notch sharp crested weir. The initial intention was to only operate the station for one year and therefore only a temporary structure having a plywood and steel notch with sandbag walls was built. Only about 3 months of record were collected before, in May 1974, high storm runoff washed out the wing walls resulting in it being discontinued. In June 1974, the East Subbasin was completely burned by forest fire and it was decided to reconstruct the weir to monitor post fire runoff through forest regeneration. In July 1974, a 120<sup>o</sup> v-notch sharp crested concrete weir was built by ELA staff. The concrete was never treated. A Leupold and Stevens A-71 water level recorder provided continuous record from early or mid-April until the end of October (seven month record) each year from 1975 to 1984. This station has been referred to as the “rock lip weir” in some reports. Effects of the forest fire and preceding wind storm (1973) have been published by Schindler et al. (1980).

This station behaved very well during most flow seasons but was difficult to operate during the rising limb and peak segments of the spring hydrograph due to winter flood ice buildup at the weir. Due to the difficulty in accessing this station in winter, the normal winter observations made at most stations were not carried out here. Therefore, no data exists for the November to early April winter periods but flows were believed to be zero to very low.

Service and data computation was by ELA staff in 1973 and 1974 but this responsibility transferred to Water Survey of Canada in 1975. Records exist for the years 1973 to 1984. Original water level charts for 1973 and 1974 are Stevens Type F weekly charts on file with ELA Hydrologic Studies. Original Leupold and Stevens A-35 float water level recorder charts for the years 1975 to 1984 are on file with WSC. A standard rain gauge was located beside the weir and read weekly from 1976 to 1984. This station was discontinued at the end of the 1984 season.

<u>Clean-up</u>

In April 2014, the responsibility for ownership and operation of the ELA transferred from DFO to IISD. As part of that agreement, a major cleanup of many research sites was undertaken. The remains of the weir were not removed during the cleanup, and as of January 2025, persist just downstream of the trail.
