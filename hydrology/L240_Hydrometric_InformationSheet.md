<u>The Watershed</u>

The Hayes Lake (Lake 240) watershed has a total drainage area of 723 hectares and has two major stream inflows from Lake 239 and from Lake 470. The lake 470 contribution also includes upstream lakes 661, 303 and 304. Together, these 5 tributary lakes account for 77% of the total Lake 240 drainage basin. The Lake 239 watershed alone makes up 54% of the Lake 240 watershed. Both of these inflow streams are monitored year-round and usually flow all year. The remainder of contributing drainage area is from the terrestrial areas surrounding the lake where inflow occurs in the form of ungauged direct runoff, both by overland flow and by small poorly defined intermittent streams. Drainage basin areas were determined from the topographical map produced by Western Photogrammetry Limited (1970) at a scale of 1:4800 and a contour interval of 10 feet (3 m). The watershed has been affected by two major forest fires since 1969. A fire that began June 26, 1974 swept much of the ELA burning more than 300 km<sup>2</sup> including about 37% of the Lake 240 watershed. The portion affected was 100% of the terrestrial area east of a line running from the northeast corner of Lake 239 (the Roddy Trail) through the Lake 239 outflow to the Lake 240 outflow. A second fire that began June 19, 1980 burned the entire Lake 240 watershed with the exception of the immediate area around the field station buildings.

<u>The Hydrometric Station</u>

Hydrometric work on the outflow of Lake 240 began March 27, 1969 when a concrete, compound weir was constructed by Water Survey of Canada (WSC) on the well-defined outflow stream at the south end of the lake. This station is referred to as Station ID: 05PD015 and Site Name: Lake 240 Outlet near Kenora in WSC publications and data base. This two-stage weir incorporates a 120<sup>o</sup> sharp crested steel v-notch for flows from 0 to 0.3 m of head and a flat crested overflow section for stages above 0.3 m. A stable metering section was established downstream, stream discharge measurements were collected over several years and a stage-discharge relationship was developed for both ranges of stage. Periodic measurements of discharge continue to be made for the purpose of verifying the relationship over time. The concrete has never been sealed with any chemical substance. This weir has been relatively maintenance free until October 11, 2001 when fairly major concrete repairs were carried out. At this time, the original 6” drain was filled with concrete since it had rusted shut.

Due to significant leaks and deterioration of concrete, further repairs occurred between early September and early October 2018, which included the demolition and re-design/construction of the v-notch portion of the weir. The flat crested overflow section was rebuilt to match its original condition, while the v-notch section was rebuilt out of 4x4 treated timbers instead of concrete. The base of the v-notch section is a 6x6 treated timber, seated in a layer of Duracrete, and anchored to the bedrock with rock bolts that are counter sunk into the timber. The treated 4x4s were then lag bolted into the 6x6 timber, and steel notch bolted on top. The upstream side of this section is covered with ¾ treated plywood. All joins are sealed with Vulkem 116 caulking. The original v-notch steel was refurbished and used once again, reinstalled at the same elevation as originally installed (confirmed by survey A-35 p.43 (after), p.46 (before)). An ABS 4” drain was installed near the notch through the concrete wall. The stable metering section will be rebuilt once flows are low again, and the stage-discharge relationship will be verified with the new design.

The weir incorporated a metal shed and concrete stilling well to house water level recording equipment that varied over time. From 1969 to 1975, a Leupold and Stevens Type-A analog chart float recorder was used. Continuous year-round record was made possible with the use of a propane heater in winter. This proved to be expensive, labour intensive and somewhat dangerous when, in the early 1970s, an explosion damaged the building and injured an ELA staff member. In 1975, the float system was replaced with a servo-manometer pressure gauge connected to a Type-A chart recorder. This system used a nitrogen gas purging system and manometer tube and reservoir containing elemental mercury. While this instrument had the advantage of providing data all year without requiring heat in winter, it also had the disadvantage of being somewhat more complex and problematic. This equipment was also potentially hazardous to the environment with respect to mercury spills. This gauge was discontinued in 1990 and replaced with a Leupold and Stevens Type-A float driven chart recorder. From 1990 to present, the recording equipment at this station was operated from mid-March to early November each year with monthly visits in winter to obtain flow estimates. For a few years, beginning in 1991 until 1995, a Stevens Type 420 data logger and SDII transducer was tried without much success and so the analog chart record remained our primary record until 1999. In March 1999, the equipment was replaced with an OTT Thalimedes data logger with float potentiometer. This logger provided digital record from mid-March to early November each year supplemented with monthly visits in winter to obtain manual flow measurements. In some years during the 2010’s when flow conditions permitted, flows during the winter were measured using a vented pressure transducer (OTT Orpheus Mini).

The OTT Thalimedes was replaced with a Sutron SDR-0001-1 in June 2020, and the OTT Orpheus Mini with a Solinst Levelogger 5 (model 3001) on 20 May 2022. The Solinst Levelogger (pressure sensor) usually remains active from April-October and collects early spring data, acts as a backup logger to the Sutron SDR, and records water temperature.

The data reported for this station is surface water discharge. The vicinity around the outflow is bedrock controlled and therefore the possibility of groundwater seepage out of the lake has always been considered to be highly unlikely. An investigation of the outflow lower stream channel and surrounding area during a dry, no flow period was carried out and no seepage areas between Lake 240 and downstream Lake 979 were found.

Access to this station is by boat during the open water period and snowmobile in winter. For approximately two or three weeks before ice-off and after ice-on, travel to the station is usually risky or not possible because of unsafe ice conditions.

<u>Rating Curve Equations</u>

The current rating curve equation is version 6, from 1989, which was computed by ELA staff from flow measurements. Beginning in 2023, flow measurements have been recorded using a Fluvia RC3 flow meter that measures the velocity of water, which will eventually be used to create an updated rating curve equation.

<u>Mercury Manometer Pressure Gauge</u>

From 1975 to 1990, a servo-manometer pressure gauge connected to a Type-A chart recorder belonging to Water Survey of Canada was located in the metal weir house at this station. The manometer and connected reservoir contained a substantial quantity (0.68 kg) of triple distilled mercury. This system was dismantled by ELA staff in 1990 and returned to WSC. All mercury was removed from ELA. In 2001, as part of an EC national project, all decommissioned mercury manometer sites were inspected and sampled. This site was sampled on September 14, 2001 and results were published in a report dated March 20, 2002 by Dillon Consulting (Assessment and Remediation of 25 Hydrometric Stations in Northwestern Ontario, Kenora/Thunder Bay Areas). Vapour readings from six sites in the immediate vicinity of the recorder shelter and a seventh background site were undetectable. Total soil mercury at 4 sites around the building (0.16, 0.12, 4.0 and 3.5 mg/kg) were below the MOE guideline of 10 mg/kg. Based on the field screening criteria, the findings concluded that site cleanup was not required. The building that housed this equipment was dismantled and removed from ELA by ELA staff in January 2002.

<u>Groundwater Seepage Inflow</u>

In 2003, a small seepage inflow site was located on the east shore of Lake 240. The up-welling water was from a point source approximately 1-2 m offshore in about 0.5 m depth. The point is approximately at the intersection of lines 575 m south from the outlet of Lake 239 and 624 m north from the outlet of Lake 240 to the north end of a sand beach on the east shore (UTM coordinates: 15U 0447916E 5500419N, WGS84). The emerging groundwater was 9.5<sup>o</sup>C while the ambient lake water was 23<sup>o</sup>C. Measurements of flow were not taken. Further investigations will be required to determine the behaviour and magnitude of this seepage source.
