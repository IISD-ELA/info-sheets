\* The watershed area of Lake 302 determined from the 2017 DEM has yet to be ground-truthed.

<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 302 is located along Pine Road approximately 3 km from the ELA field station. This headwater lake is approximately 414 m above mean sea level and has a surface area and total watershed area (including water surface) of 23.7 and 102.5 hectares, respectively. The lake has two basins of nearly equal proportions that are separated by a narrowing of the lake and a centrally located island. The upstream, or southwest basin, has a water surface area of 7.77 ha and a total drainage area (including water surface) of 48.69 ha. The downstream, or northeast basin, has a water surface area of 8.32 ha and a total drainage area (including water surface and excluding the southwest basin) of 48.48 ha. Drainage areas are based on the topographical map produced by Lockwood Surveys (1972) at a scale of 1:7920 from aerial photos taken in 1969-70. Flow from Lake 302 enters the much larger Roddy (468) Lake and, via Teggau and Eagle Lakes, eventually makes its way to Lake Winnipeg by the English, Wabigoon, and Winnipeg River systems.

Hydrological monitoring began in 1980 in support of a whole lake acidification experiment. Between June 11 and July 8, 1981, a “sea curtain” barrier was placed in each of the two passages (either side of the island) between the basins to prevent the movement of fishes and water mixing between the two basins. The curtain did not prevent the hydrologic movement of water from the upstream to downstream basin. Hydrometric instrumentation on this lake has consisted of a recording weir at the lake outflow, a recording lake level station and a recording weir on a small terrestrial subcatchment. A beaver dam located at the outlet and approximately 8 m above the outflow weir influenced lake water levels and, subsequently, the discharge hydrograph in most years.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 302 Outflow.

Discharges reported for 1980 were computed (by ELA staff) based on a stage-discharge relationship between measured discharge in the natural open channel at the outflow and manually observed staff gauge readings of lake level. Discharges reported for 1981 were also computed by ELA staff and were also based on the same stage-discharge relationship but improved somewhat with the addition of a recording lake level station. From September 21 to 26, 1981, a 60<sup>o</sup> sharp crested v-notch concrete weir was constructed on the outflow stream by Water Survey of Canada (WSC). A helicopter was used to fly all building materials and wet concrete from Roddy Landing. The weir was constructed on bedrock and subsurface seepage in the vicinity of the weir and lower reaches of the stream channel could not be detected. The weir began operation on April 1, 1982 as a seven-month (April to October) seasonal station to obtain mean daily discharges. Typically, flow from small ELA lakes, in winter, is very low to non-existent. Field visits were made to the weir at least monthly, in winter, first of all to determine whether or not flow was present and obtain a discharge measurement if flow was occurring. This additional data allowed for winter flow estimates to be made by a combination of interpolation, comparison with other stations and examination of precipitation record. From 1982 to 1998, analog record was collected with a Leupold and Stevens A-71 float actuated chart water level recorder which was set to head. In 1999, the station was upgraded with an OTT Thalimedes float actuated data logger. Seasonal records from 1982 to 1984 were computed by WSC and, since April 1,1985, by ELA Hydrology staff. The calibration equation used in all years was Q = 0.8213H<sup>2.51</sup> (theoretical) where H is hydraulic head (m) and Q is discharge (m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) and has been verified with field discharge measurements. The weir was constructed with a v-notch capacity of 0.380 m and with a small overflow section to H = 0.450 m at which point the flow tops the concrete wall. Fairly extensive concrete repairs were made to the weir in 1995 and 2000. Monitoring of this station was discontinued after 2010 and remained idle until August 2015 when the station was fully removed, and the site restored according to the DFO and IISD-ELA transfer agreement.

2.  Lake 302 Lake Level.

A staff gauge was installed on Lake 302 on August 13, 1980 and was read almost daily until October 29, 1980. In the late fall of 1980, a stilling well, staff gauge and Leupold and Stevens A-71 float actuated chart recorder were installed by WSC to obtain continuous record of lake stage during the open water season. The record for this station begins in April 1981. In 2001, this station was upgraded with an OTT Thalimedes float actuated data logger. Data from 1981 to 1984 were computed by WSC and, since April 1, 1985, by ELA Hydrology staff. This station was removed during the DFO cleanup in 2014.

A new gauge board was installed on 30 June 2023 in the original location, with an OG top elevation of 28.338 m, and a DWL of 27.946 m. The gauge board read 0.560 m at install. All levels reported are relative to an assumed arbitrary benchmark elevation, not mean sea level. Gauge board removed on 17 May 2024.

3.  Lake Upland Terrestrial Watershed

This small 7.2 ha drainage basin was chosen in 1986 as a typical upland terrestrial watershed for chemical and hydrological monitoring. In August 1986, a concrete 90<sup>o</sup> sharp-crested weir was constructed by ELA personnel on the small intermittent stream from the catchment. This weir was instrumented with a Leupold and Stevens A-71 float actuated chart recorder and later upgraded to an OTT Thalimedes float actuated data logger in 2001. This station was operated primarily for seasonal record and, therefore, winter and some spring runoff record are marginal. This weir was built on bedrock and there has been no evidence of subsurface seepage. The concrete was sealed with a petroleum-based foundation coat at the time of construction. The station was fully removed in August 2015, and the site restored according to the DFO and IISD-ELA transfer agreement.

In 1987, Airquest Resource Surveys was contracted to take new aerial photographs and to produce a new contour map of this upland subcatchment at a scale of 1:1000 with 1 m contour resolution. The drainage basin area (7.20 ha) was determined by a closed traverse ground survey around the watershed boundary. Permanent markers were established at 26 inflection points by drilling and marking 1.6 cm diameter holes in the bedrock around the drainage basin.

In addition to this weir, there are also a number of very small (\<1 ha) “mini-catchments” with very small weirs that were later developed along the Lake 302 western ridge adjacent the 302 Upland Watershed. These small experimental sites were developed initially by graduate student, Craig Allan, in the late 1980’s and then were continued by Sebastein Lamontagne, also a graduate student. These sites are not part of the ELA Hydrology network.
