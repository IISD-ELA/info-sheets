<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 114 is located along to the Pine Road approximately 2.5 km from the ELA field station. The lake is a headwater lake with a surface area of 12.1 ha and total watershed area of 57.7 hectares above the hydrometric monitoring station. The lake outlet is located some 200 m upstream of this gauging site. Water leaves the lake through a small wetland area by a poorly defined stream segment that flows to a small pond locally referred to as the “Moose Pond”. This pond drains through a culvert under the road. Drainage areas are based on the topographical map produced by Lockwood Surveys (1972) at a scale of 1:7920 from aerial photos taken in 1969-70. Portions of the watershed were previously logged and scarified in the 1970’s. By 1977, approximately 60% of the terrestrial basin had been logged by the Minnesota and Ontario Pulp and paper Company (Kenora). The cutting took place in two stages, with the south and southeast portions being cut in the winter of 1973/74 and the east and northeast portions being cut in 1976. In July, 1979, the area that was cut in 1976 was scarified to encourage forest regeneration (Beaty, 1981, 1984).

The L114 inflow watershed area was mapped by Airquest Resource Surveys in 1987.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 114 Outflow.

In late 1970, a hydrometric control was established on the outflow stream by Water Survey of Canada (WSC). The structure was a steel H-flume set in concrete with a 2-foot (0.6 m) deep design, 2-inch (5 cm) outlet, equipped with a Leupold and Stevens A-35 analog chart and float water level recorder and staff gauge. The flume was located on the downstream side of the road about 3 m below the culvert. The concrete was never sealed with foundation tar or other chemical sealers. Occasional concrete repairs were made over the years. The outflow area is not bedrock controlled. The flume rests on boulder gravel till with the upstream road serving as a cut-off dike. This station was operated from early to mid-April to the end of October each year (seven-month record) from 1971 to 1994 when it was discontinued for a six-year period. In September 2000, the original steel flume was removed and replaced with a new 120<sup>o</sup> sharp crested v-notch weir with a notch and dike capacity of 0.330 m and 0.340 m respectively. Record resumed November 1, 2000. An OTT Thalimedes float actuated data logger was used from mid-April to the end of October each year. In June 2016, this weir was removed and replaced new with the same design and dimensions as the previous weir. In winter, monthly visits were made in each year of operation to obtain manual flow measurements (see “winter flow”). In some years, beaver activity has affected flow through the road culvert. As of 26 April 2018, this station is equipped with a Sutron SDR-0001-1 shaft-encoder type water level logger. The use of an OTT Thalimedes logger was discontinued on 21 October 2020. A Solinst Levelogger 5 (model 3001) was deployed on 12 April 2023 and usually remains from April-October each year. The Solinst Levelogger (pressure sensor) collects early spring data, acts as a backup logger to the Sutron SDR, and records water temperature.

2.  Lake 114 Lake Level.

In 1978, a staff gauge was installed on Lake 114 and 33 manual gauge readings were taken from May through October. In October 1980, a stilling well and Leupold Stevens A-35 float and chart recorder were installed by WSC to obtain continuous record during the open water season with record beginning in 1981. At the end of the 1990 season, this station was discontinued due to a lack of resources and a shift to other priorities. Occasional manual gauge readings were obtained in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 2000. In July 2001, this station was re-activated in support of the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Repairs were made to the existing (1980) stilling well and staff gauge installation and an OTT Thalimedes data logger was used to collect continuous record. This station was rebuilt in 2011, and continues to be operated each open-water season. As of, 21 April 2023, this station is equipped with a Sutron SDR-0001 shaft-encoder type water level logger. The OTT Thalimedes logger was removed and use discontinued on 21 October 2020.

3.  Lake 114 Terrestrial Inflow

In July, 1979, a weir was installed on a small intermittent stream entering the northeast corner of the lake 143 m upstream from the lake. The structure was a 90<sup>o</sup> sharp crested v-notch weir that was intended as a temporary station. The weir plate was plywood fitted with a steel edge and the wing walls were made of earth and rock. The stilling pond and dike were lined with plastic which was then covered with local soil. This weir was instrumented with a Leupold and Stevens type F float recorder with a weekly chart. This was considered a low priority station and only partial records were obtained during the 1979 to 1983 period. With the exception of the very small “mini-catchments” that were later developed in the Lake 302 Upland, this was the smallest terrestrial catchment monitored at ELA. The drainage area was estimated to be 3.64 ha and was totally within the portion of the watershed that was logged in 1976 and later scarified in the early summer of 1979. In September of 1983, a new 120<sup>o</sup> concrete sharp crested v-notch weir was constructed by ELA staff approximately 10 m downstream of the first temporary weir (133 m upstream of the lake). The weir was built on bedrock and incorporated a long, low concrete wall to capture and direct storm runoff toward the stilling pond. The concrete was never treated with tar or chemical based sealers however, in August 1988, the concrete was coated with a two-part epoxy paint manufactured by Pratt & Lambert. This weir was instrumented with a Leupold and Stevens A-71 float and chart recorder. On June 30, 1987, the notch was changed to a 90<sup>o</sup> V to improve sensitivity at low flow. This weir was operated from early April until the end of October (approximately seven-month record) each year from 1984 until it was discontinued at the end of the 2000 season. In winter, occasional visits were made to obtain measurements. Winter flow was usually zero. The location of this new weir resulted in a slightly larger drainage area of 5.73 ha. In 1987, new contour mapping was produced by AirQuest Resource Surveys at a scale of 1:1000 with 1 m contours based on existing 1982 aerial photography. At the end of the 2000 season, this station was discontinued. The weir has not been removed or properly decommissioned.
