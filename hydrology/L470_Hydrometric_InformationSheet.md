<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 470 is located approximately 350 m west of the ELA field station. L470 is a small 4.24 hectare, 4<sup>th</sup> order lake with max and mean depths of 1.7 m and 0.79 m, respectively. L470 has one inflow at the north end and flows south into Lake 240. The upstream lake, L661, is an even smaller lake that flows east into L470. The watershed of L470 is approximately 167.71 hectares (Beaty and Lyng, 1989), and includes lakes 303, 304, and 661.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 470 Outflow

Hydrological work began April 11, 1969 with manual readings at the natural outflow. By September 16<sup>th</sup>, 1969 an abbreviated 6‚Äù trapezoidal flume was installed, equipped with a Stevens A-35 chart recorder. Between 1994 and 2000, 470Q was equipped with a Leupold & Stevens Type A/F Logger. Since 2000, 470Q has been equipped with an OTT Thalimedes data logger. A Sutron Stage-Discharge Recorder (SDR) was installed in place of the OTT Thalimedes in the spring of 2020, however was swapped for an OTT Thalimedes shortly after due to a malfunction. Switched back to a Sutron SDR-0001-1 on 31 August 2020.

The L470 outflow is supplied with power by running a buried cable from the field station, parallel to the trail. In this way, the station was kept from freezing during the winter months, allowing for a year-round flow record. The initial setup, data collection, and data processing were carried out by the Water Survey of Canada (WSC). WSC was involved until the end of December 1995. Since 1995, the station has been run by ELA staff. Lake 470 outflow has been operated year-round since 1995 with the exception of 1999 and 2000. The outflow has not been operated during the winter months since 2012.

Construction on the weir occurred during October 2011 to repair leakage that was occurring. The beaver dam on L661 has occasionally been removed or modified to increase the flow of water through this station, data affected by this has the qualifier code for beaver activity (D2). Major rain event on 9-10 July 2019 resulted in station being flooded, water flowing overland on either side of weir, and missing data.
