<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 375 is located along the Pine Road approximately 15 km to the northwest of the ELA field station. The Pine Road crosses through the watershed between lakes 373 and 375. Access to the lake is by a short (~200 m) walking trail from the Pine Road. Lake 375 is a second order lake with a surface area of 23.2 ha and total watershed area of 219.3 hectares above the lake outlet. The lake outflow stream flows out through a small wetland area by a poorly defined stream segment which eventually passes over a bedrock sill to a steep and rugged open channel to downstream Manomin Lake (L376). The upstream Lake 373 watershed is the tributary lake to Lake 375 and is the major inflow accounting for approximately 40% of the Lake 375 drainage basin area. Drainage areas are based on the topographical map produced by Airquest Resource Surveys (1985) at a scale of 1:5000 based on aerial photos taken in 1982. Portions of the upper watershed were previously logged in the 1980’s.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

The outflow of Lake 375 is not monitored because of the absence of suitable construction sites on the outflow stream. Access to the outflow is also very difficult during the spring, late fall and winter. There are two hydrometric stations within the Lake 375 watershed, one is a weir on the major inflow from Lake 373 and the other is a lake level station on Lake 375.

1.  Lake 375 Inflow:

The Lake 373 Outflow Weir which monitors the major stream inflow to Lake 375 is described in greater detail in the “Lake 373: Hydrometric Station Information Sheet”. There were two weir locations for this station which, although very close in proximity, result in two different internal watershed area values. Therefore, care must be taken when using the data or extrapolating it to other locations. The first weir was a 120<sup>o</sup> sharp crested v-notch concrete weir on bedrock established November 1, 1989. It was located on the west side of the Pine Road. Unfortunately, it was often subject to serious winter and early spring freezing that resulted in lost record. This station was relocated approximately 25 m downstream on the east side of the Pine Road. The second weir was a 120<sup>o</sup> sharp crested v-notch weir constructed of painted pressure treated plywood imbedded in a plastic lined gravel dike. It was established November 1, 2002. The respective watershed areas above the 1989 and 2002 weirs were 81.9 and 88.4 hectares.

2.  Lake 375 Lake Level:

In 1991, a staff gauge and a survey benchmark were installed on Lake 375. From 1991 to 1995, 19 manual gauge readings were taken over 5 open water seasons. In June 2002, a new gauge board, stilling well and OTT Thalimedes data logger were installed to obtain continuous lake level record during the open water season. Logger record at this station was discontinued May 1, 2012, however was re-established May 1, 2021, using an OTT Thalimedes data logger. OTT Thalimedes replaced with a Sutron SDR-0001-1 on 9 June 2022.
