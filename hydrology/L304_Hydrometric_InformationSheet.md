Watershed area (ha): 26.42 ha based on 1970 mapping

XX.X ha based on 2017 DEM\*

\* The watershed area of Lake 304 determined from the 2017 DEM has yet to be ground-truthed.

<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 304 is located approximately 1.3 km west of the ELA field station. L304 is a small 3.6 hectare 1<sup>st</sup> order lake that flows south and eventually east into L661 and onwards. The watershed of L304 is 26.4 hectares.

During the November to March winter period, records do not exist. The lake level was beaver controlled from the beginning of hydrometric observations in 1969. On June 2 1982, and 0.5 m trench was cut through the dam at the outflow down to the bedrock sill. Near zero flow at the sill was at a WL of 53.510. Beaver activity had not affected lake levels between 1982 and when the lake level station was decommissioned in 1990.

A direct water level (DWL) survey on July 1, 2010 of 53.567 m indicated that beaver activity had not affected lake levels in subsequent years. A more recent DWL survey (October 26, 2016, A-37, p16) show the lake level at 54.764 m. This level is 1.134 m above the average lake level value (53.630 m) reported during the 1969-1990 period, indicating beaver activity may once again control lake levels. This survey was carried out after the removal of the water level station in 2015.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 304 Lake Level (WSC ID 05PD018)

Hydrological work began July 8, 1969 with the install of a stilling well and analog chart recorder. Water level data was recorded during the open water season until October 31, 1990. Weir, stilling well, logger, and data were installed and managed by the WSC. Station dismantled and removed in the fall of 2015, as per the cleanup agreement between DFO and IISD during the transfer of ELA.

A gauge board was installed 30 May 2024 and is intermittently monitored throughout April-October.

<u>History</u>

Early hydrological investigations were carried out jointly through an arrangement with the U of M and WSC, which included construction services, technical support, instrumentation and determination of mean daily discharge and mean daily lake level record as well as some financial support. The WSC continued to provide the loan of 22 water level recorders after 1985 until they became obsolete and were decommissioned.

The L304 water level was managed by the WSC (data can be found here: <https://tinyurl.com/L304W>). This water level station has since been dismantled and removed in the fall of 2015, as per the cleanup agreement between DFO and IISD during the transfer of ELA.
