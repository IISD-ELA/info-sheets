<u>The Watershed</u>

The Lake 979 watershed has a total drainage area of 821 hectares and receives most of its input from the Lake 240 watershed. The Lake 240 contribution is monitored and includes upstream lakes 239, 470, 661, 303 and 304. Together, these 6 tributary lakes account for 88% of the total Lake 979 drainage basin. There is also a well-defined terrestrial drainage area to the east of the lake. This stream lacks a suitable monitoring site and is best estimated by using the East Inflow to Lake 239 as a surrogate sub-catchment. The remainder of contributing drainage area is from the terrestrial areas surrounding the lake where inflow occurs in the form of ungauged direct runoff, both by overland flow and by small poorly defined intermittent streams. Drainage basin areas were determined from the topographical map produced by Western Photogrammetry Limited (1970) at a scale of 1:4800 for the Lake 240 watershed and topographical mapping of the Lake 979 basin below Lake 240 by Airquest Resource Surveys (1991) at scale of 1:1000. The watershed has been affected by two major forest fires since1969. Significant areas within the Lake 979 and tributary watersheds were burned by fires in 1974 and 1980 (see “forest fire history”).

<u>The Hydrometric Stations</u>

The outlet of Lake 979 is located at latitude 49<sup>o</sup> 38” 40” and longitude 93<sup>o</sup> 43’ 30”. Hydrometric work on the outflow of Lake 979 began in June, 1991 with preliminary surveys and the beginning of construction for the ELA Reservoir Project (ELARP) dam and weir. On June 17, 1991, a stilling well was located on the Lake 979 pond equipped with a Stevens A-71 chart recorder and Stevens A/F data logger. A concrete 150<sup>o</sup> v-notch sharp crested weir was constructed on sound bedrock by ELA staff on the well defined outflow stream at the south end of the lake. The weir was operational with record beginning on October 23, 1991. Thirty stream discharge measurements were obtained for a range of flows and a stage-discharge rating curve was developed by March 1993. The concrete weir wall was sealed with a tar based foundation coat to extend the life of the concrete. A stilling well and box shelter to house recording equipment with a connecting wooden walkway were also constructed with the weir. Recording equipment varied over time. From 1991 to 1994, a Leupold and Stevens Type A71 analog chart float recorder was used in conjunction with a Stevens 420 data logger and SDII transducer. While for most of that period, the 420 data logger system served as the primary record supplemented by chart record, the system eventually proved to be problematic and was discontinued in 1994. The A71 chart recorder was used in all years and served as the primary record until the end of 1998. From March 1999 to 2009, an OTT Thalimedes data logger with float assembly has been used as the primary record for this station with chart record serving as backup. The recording equipment at this station was operated seasonally from mid-March to early November each year with routine monthly visits in winter to obtain manual flow estimates (see “winter flow”). Data collection ceased for this outflow station at the end of 2009.

Lake levels were similarly recorded in a separate stilling well located on the wall of the dam from 1993 to 2008 with occasional observations in 2009. No pond level data was collected after the 2009 season.

<u>Record of Impoundment</u>

Lake 979 was regulated during all open water seasons from June 1993 to October 2008 by adding timbers to a stop-log structure in a low level (1.5 m) dam at the outflow in spring and removing them in the fall. The time to fill and drawdown varied each year depending on the magnitude of inflow to the system. While the time to fill ranged from one week to several weeks, drawdown could usually be achieved in 5 to 8 days. Subsequently, the regulation of Lake 979 resulted in decreased flows in the spring during filling and irregular high flows in October during drawdown. For a more information on regulation refer to the discussion for station 979W.

There was no flooding in 2009. The reservoir was maintained at normal winter levels until July 28 when the outflow control part of the structure was removed. From July 29, 2009 forward the 979 pond was at pre-construction levels. Beaver activity was not managed after this date.

<u>The Hydrometric Data</u>

The data reported for this station is surface water discharge. The vicinity around the outflow is bedrock controlled and therefore the possibility of groundwater seepage is assumed to be highly unlikely. Investigation of the outflow lower stream channel and surrounding area during a dry, no flow period revealed no wet or seepage areas. The area between upstream Lake 240 and Lake 979 were also investigated. Based on careful examination, both the major inflow and outflow areas are believed to be hydrologically sound.

Access to this station is by boat and canoe during the open water period and snowmobile in winter. For approximately two or three weeks before ice-off and after ice-on, travel to the station is risky and usually not possible because of unsafe ice conditions. Recording equipment was normally operated from mid-April until early November. In winter, monthly visits to the station were made to obtain estimates of streamflow from manual observations. These values have been coded in the data base (“A”). Often beaver interfere with the operation of this station by damming either the outflow control structure or the v-notch weir. When beaver activity has affected the record, the mean daily values have been coded “D” to imply that the value is a “best estimate” due to the presence of beaver.

At times record may be missing either because recording equipment could not be operated at times such as in winter, or due to malfunction or disturbance (animal or otherwise). Wherever possible, missing record has been estimated and has marked with a qualifying code (see “quality of record”).

<u>Site Decommissioning and Clean-up</u>

As a requirement of the transfer of the ELA from DFO to IISD-ELA, a major clean-up of lakes and watersheds was carried out under a DFO initiated contract during the 2015 field season. As part of this initiative, all installations and debris from the ELARP study, including the dam, weir and lake level installations were removed.
