Watershed area (ha): 69.7 ha based on 1972 mapping

XX.XX ha based on 2017 DEM\*

\* The watershed area of Lake 120 determined from the 2017 DEM has yet to be ground-truthed.

<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 120 is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) west of the ELA field station and inside the old north and south loops logging road. It is approximately a 1.5 km overland hike northwest from the south loop portion of the logging road and therefore access is poor and relatively difficult. This lake was never part of the ELA-Ontario agreement.

Lake 120 is a headwater lake with a surface area of 9.31 hectares and total watershed area of 69.7 ha above the hydrometric monitoring station. During the period of record, a beaver dam existed at the lake outlet but above the weir. The watershed area is based on the Lockwood Survey contour maps (1972) at a scale of 1:7920 from aerial photos taken in 1969-70 which is still the best scale available for this part of the ELA.

This lake is meromictic and was the focus of a Masters thesis by P. Campbell (1976). Hydrological work on Lake 120 has consisted of estimates of annual flow for the years 1970, 1971 and 1972 by Campbell, and monitored flows for 1973 and 1974 by Water Survey of Canada (WSC) and ELA staff.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 120 Outflow.

The estimates for annual outflow by Campbell were calculated by subtracting surface evaporation from the total input. Values of precipitation, runoff and evaporation from the Rawson (239) watershed were used, and storage was assumed to be zero. The estimates were as follows:

1970. 223,500 m3

1971. 233,600

1972. 147,500

The operation of a 60<sup>o</sup> sharp crested v-notch weir and water level recorder was commenced by WSC on April 4, 1972. This weir was a “temporary” structure made of a steel notch, plywood and earthen lined walls with plastic sheeting and was operated from mid-April to the end of October in 1972, 1973 by WSC and 1974 by ELA. The record for 1972 was insufficient for work-up and required the above estimate to be made. In the early years of the ELA project, winter flows were assumed to be insignificant and therefore no winter visits were made to this difficult site. Service of the station and calculation of the flows were carried out by WSC staff in 1972 and 1973 and by ELA staff in 1974. All original water level recorder charts are on file with WSC. The operation of this station was discontinued following the 1974 field season. The weir remained idle until August 2015 when the station was fully removed, and the site restored according to the DFO and IISD-ELA transfer agreement.
