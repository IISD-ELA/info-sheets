Hydrometric work on this stream began in 1969 but consisted only of a few discharge measurements in that year. On June 24, 1970, Water Survey of Canada (WSC) constructed a temporary 120˚ V-notch sharp-crested weir of plywood with plastic lining. The weir was located along a segment of stream channel over a silt, sand and gravel substrate. A Leupold and Stevens A-35 provided continuous record from early to mid-April until the end of October each year (seven-month record). By 1976, and after several major repairs, serious weir deterioration required that a new weir be constructed. On August 28, 1976, a new 120˚ V-notch sharp crested weir was constructed by WSC approximately 2 m downstream of the original weir. It incorporated slightly wider wing walls to each side with 2.5 m lengths of corrugated sheet metal which were driven vertically to provide a seepage cutoff wall. By the end of 1985, a combination of frost heave and damage by storm flows made replacement of this weir necessary. On August 26, 1986 construction of a third new weir was completed by ELA staff at the same location as the previous weir. The new structure was a plywood and steel 120˚ V-notch plate in a treated timber structure with extensive earth dikes to each side. The weir was rebuilt again in June 1996 and September 2003. By 2010, the weir had tilted inward towards the pond due to frost heave. ELA staff used the excavator to return the weir to vertical. Despite the correction, the weir had once again leaned heavily towards the pond and required rebuilding. The weir was replaced entirely in 2019 by Kurt Hangle and ELA staff. The replacement weir was constructed to the same dimensions as the previous version, however it was anchored with 6 ground screws to prevent shifting. The weir wall dikes were improved and the notch was lowered to an elevation of 30.346 m. The vertical opening above the notch was also increased in order to handle extreme storm flows. A description of the rebuild can be found in ‘NWIF Weir Rebuild 2019.docx’ in the information sheet folder for NWIF.

A Leupold and Stevens A-71 float water level recorder provided continuous record from late March to early November (seven months) until the end of 1995. From April 1996 to November 1999, a Stevens Stand-Alone data logger was used to collect data and, in March 2000, the station was upgraded with an OTT Thalimedes float-potentiometer data logger. In winter, monthly streamflow observations have been made since 1978 to allow for winter estimates to be made.

As of 15 May 2017, the NWIF has had a Sutron SDR-0001-4 shaft encoder and a CDOM sensor, in place of the OTT Thalimedes. On 8 April 2019, a Solinst Levelogger 5 (model 3001) was added and usually remains active from April-October each year. The Solinst Levelogger (pressure sensor) collects early spring data, acts as a backup logger to the Sutron SDR, and records water temperature.

<u>Influence of the Flooded Uplands Dynamics Experiment (FLUDEX) on the NWIF to Lake 239</u>

Two experiments have been conducted at ELA that have introduced foreign Roddy Lake (468) water to the Lake 239 Watershed. From 1983 to 1990, water from Roddy Lake was sprayed by irrigation over the Northeast Subbasin. This “extra” water became incorporated in the natural runoff that passed over the weir and into Lake 239. The second experiment was the Flooded Uplands Dynamics Experiment (FLUDEX). The FLUDEX project created three small artificial reservoirs that received water by continuous pumping from Roddy Lake for approximately 110 to 120 days each year between 1999 and 2003. One of the sites, Site 2, was located along the divide between the Roddy Lake and Rawson Lake watersheds. While the outflow from the reservoir returned to Roddy Lake during the “flooded” period, some water did enter the Northwest Subbasin and therefore Lake 239. This water was in the form of ongoing daily seepage from the dam and also the emptying of the reservoir at the end of each season. Seepage input to the NW Subbasin averaged 1 L/s (0.001 m<sup>3</sup>/s) over the 5 flooded seasons. Since this water had to travel the length of the sub-catchment before reaching the weir, it is likely that much of it was likely lost to evapotranspiration before reaching the lake. At the end of each season, the reservoir volume (~4300 m<sup>3</sup>) was drained into the NW Subbasin over approximately a two-day period. This created a “false” pulse in the NWIF hydrograph that was “real” to the receiving waters (Lake 239) but “false” to the natural runoff behavior of the sub-catchment.

Users of this data during the years 1999 to 2003 are therefore cautioned that some interpretation of the runoff and its chemistry maybe necessary depending on the application of the data. Water volumes and dates effected are available on request.

Notes on FLUDEX circa 2003:

**NWIF to L 239**

**2003**

FLUDEX Reservoir 2 is located at the top of the Northwest Subbasin. Small but continuous seepage under the reservoir walls and dikes occurred at varying rates during the period of operation (approx 110 days each year) during the 5 years 1999 to 2003 inclusive. In the fall, the reservoir was emptied adding approximately 4266 m3 of foreign water to the NW Subbasin and Lake 239.

Period of operation in 2003: June 5 to Sept 24<sup>th</sup>

Period of reservoir draining: Sept 24 to 30

Seepage: In 2003, an average of 103.1 m3/d was estimated to have seeped down slope from the reservoir during the 112.1 day period.

ET Loss: While it is difficult to quantify, we can assume that there are losses to evapotranspiration and estimate that approximately 69 m3/d of that water entered the lake.

Weir construction: The weir was removed and replaced between Aug 12 and Sept 24. The weir was operational on Sept 24, in time for the beginning of the draining of Reservoir 2. The spike in flow from Sept 24 to 26 is from both reservoir 2 and a rain storm.
