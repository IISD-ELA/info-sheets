<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 632 is located approximately 5 km west northwest of the ELA field station. L632 is a tiny 0.8 hectare first order lake that flows northeast into L259 and onwards. The watershed of L632 is 40.2 hectares.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 632 Outflow (WSC ID 05QD027):

Lake 632 had a gauged outflow between 1991 and 1997. The station consisted of a plywood and plastic lined weir equipped with a 90<sup>o</sup> v-notch and accompanying Stevens A-71 recorder in California-type shelter. The recorder was set to head. This station operated during the open-water season, and manual measurements were taken periodically in the winter months. Site was established June 7 1991. The notch had a capacity of 0.304 m and the weir walls a capacity of 0.305 m.

2.  Lake 632 Water Level (WSC ID 05QD028):

Lake 632 had a gauged lake level station from 1991 to 1993. The station consisted of a Brancker XL-100 water level logger housed in a plexiglass shelter with float set to an outside gauge. The water level station was operated during the open-water season. Site was established May 17, 1991

<u>History</u>

Early hydrological investigations were carried out jointly through an arrangement with the U of M and WSC, which included construction services, technical support, instrumentation and determination of mean daily discharge and mean daily lake level record as well as some financial support. The WSC continued to provide the loan of 22 water level recorders after 1985 until they became obsolete and were decommissioned.

The L632 outflow and water level stations were managed by the WSC from 1991 to 1995 and 1991 to 1993, respectively. ELA managed the outflow station until 1997 (WSC data can be found here: <https://tinyurl.com/L632QandL632W>).

This outflow weir has since been dismantled and removed during the fall of 2015, as per the cleanup agreement between DFO and IISD upon the transfer of ELA.
