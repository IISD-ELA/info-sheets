Watershed area (ha): 54.14 ha based on 1970 mapping

XX.X ha based on 2017 DEM\*

\* The watershed area of Lake 303 determined from the 2017 DEM has yet to be ground-truthed.

<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 303 is located approximately 1 km west northwest of the ELA field station. L303 is a small 9.93 hectare 1<sup>st</sup> order lake that flows south into a wetland and eventually east into L661 and onwards. The watershed of L303 is 54.1 hectares.

During the November to March winter period, records do not exist. According to a direct water level (DWL) survey on October 5, 2010 of 56.482 m, beaver activity caused lake levels to rise over 0.400 m higher than during the high-water level during the 1969-1990 period. Subsequent DWL surveys (e.g. October 26, 2016, A-37, p16) show the lake level at 55.910 m. This level is 0.180 m above the average lake level value (55.730 m) reported during the 1969-1990 period. This survey was carried out after the removal of the outflow weir in 2015 as part of the DFO led clean-up during the transfer of ELA to IISD.

There is a large old beaver dam at the south end of the lake which regulates lake level. It has many small leaks but is covered in shrubs and grass and seems unlikely to change in the coming decades.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 303 Lake Level (WSC ID 05PD020)

Hydrological work began July 8, 1969 with the install of a stilling well and analog chart recorder. Water level data was recorded during the open water season until October 31, 1990. Weir, stilling well, logger, and data were installed by the WSC. Station removed in the fall of 2015, as per the cleanup agreement between DFO and IISD during the transfer of ELA.

A gauge board was installed 30 May 2024, and is intermittently monitored throughout April-October.

2.  Lake 303 Outflow (WSC ID 05PD019)

Lake 303 had a gauged outflow for the same period of time as the lake level station was in operation. A concrete weir equipped with a 120<sup>o</sup> v-notch and accompanying analog chart recorder were operated during the open water season. Station removed in the fall of 2015, as per the cleanup agreement between DFO and IISD during the transfer of ELA.

<u>History</u>

Early hydrological investigations were carried out jointly through an arrangement with the U of M and WSC, which included construction services, technical support, instrumentation and determination of mean daily discharge and mean daily lake level record as well as some financial support. The WSC continued to provide the loan of 22 water level recorders after 1985 until they became obsolete and were decommissioned.

The L303 outflow and water level were managed by the WSC (data can be found here: <https://tinyurl.com/L303WandL303Q>). These hydrometric stations were removed in the fall of 2015, as per the cleanup agreement between DFO and IISD during the transfer of ELA.
