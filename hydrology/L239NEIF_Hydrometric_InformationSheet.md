Hydrometric work on this stream began in July 1971 when a bedrock-controlled section of open channel was stabilized with a small metering section and staff gauge. A stage-discharge curve was developed for the section and in 1971, 1972 and 1973 mean daily discharges were calculated based on daily manual gauge readings. In 1974, a Leupold and Stevens Type-F weekly float recorder was placed on the stream to improve the quality and period of record. Only open water season flow data were collected. It was not until 1978 that the period of record was extended to include April spring runoff. In July 1979, this station was upgraded when the control section was replaced with a concrete flume. In 1983, the importance of this station increased when a new major project to study the effects of acidification on a wetland began. In 1983, an irrigation system was installed in the 3.67 ha wetland portion of the NE Subbasin to create artificial acidic precipitation events. Water was pumped from nearby Roddy Lake and sprayed onto the wetland on 9, 12, 13, 11, 9, 6, 11 and 6 occasions respectively in each of the years 1983 to 1990. Mean daily flow values for this station are flagged with an “S” on days that the irrigation system was operated. Volumes of Roddy Lake water pumped into the Subbasin are available. This system was described in detail by Beaty (1987). New mapping in 1982 and 1987 resulted in a new reported drainage area (Table 72) for the NE Subbasin.

On 18 July 1985, the concrete flume was replaced with a 120˚ V-notch concrete sharp crested weir at the same location. The concrete was not sealed in either structure. The v-notch weir greatly improved the quality of record, especially during the April spring snowmelt period. On 29 August 2020, the painted plywood weir wall was remade and the rotten concrete from below the notch, as well as the lower parts of the vertical concrete supports, were removed and re-poured, with bolts embedded in order to attach the new wall. The 120<sup>o</sup> v-notch was replaced with a 90<sup>o</sup> v-notch to improve the quality of the record for low-flow. The bolt-holes and edges of the concrete where they meet the painted plywood weir wall were caulked with Vulkem 116. Notch 0 elevation of the new v-notch was installed at an elevation of 45.326 m, which is ~ 0.023 m higher than the previous notch 0 elevation.

The rating formula for the 120<sup>o</sup> v-notch of this weir is Q = 4.1306H^2.602 (in operation from 18 July 1985 to 28 August 2020), calculated by ELA staff on 22 September 1989. The rating formula for the 90<sup>o</sup> v-notch of this weir (installed 29 August 2020) is Q = 1.3425H^2.47.

A Leupold and Stevens A-71 float water level recorder provided continuous record from late march to early November (seven-month record). In May 2001, this station was upgraded with an OTT Thalimedes float-potentiometer data logger. Historically, this stream froze up by mid to late November and started to run by the last week of March or first week of April. Depending on precipitation in the fall months, NEIF has continued to flow into January of the following calendar year. In winter, monthly stream flow observations have been made since 1978. No further changes occurred at this station to 11 May 2017.

This station was equipped with a Sutron SDR-0001-4 and CDOM sensor between 11 May 2017 and 10 July 2018 (not including winter months). Since 10 July 2018, this station has been equipped with a Sutron SDR-0001-1 during the open water season. On 7 April 2020, a Solinst Levelogger 5 (model 3001) was added and usually remains active from April-October each year. The Solinst Levelogger (pressure sensor) collects early spring data, acts as a backup logger to the Sutron SDR, and records water temperature. Station equipment was changed back to a Sutron SDR-0001-4 and CDOM sensor on 13 June 2022.

Seepage between the concrete edge and the plywood weir wall has been observed between August 2023-2025. Efforts were made in 2023 to reduce the leak by excavating, lying poly sheeting down, and filling cracks with concrete (Quikrete), but it continued to leak in 2024.
