<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 378 is a first order lake that is located 6.4 km northwest of the ELA field station (~ 9.3 km by road). It has a surface area of 24.26 ha and a total watershed area of 136.0 ha. Drainage areas are based on the topographical map produced by Airquest Resource Surveys (1985) at a scale of 1:5000 from aerial photos taken in 1982. Lake 378 flows west into Sheila Lake. The L378 watershed includes much bedrock, some wetland, and a lake shoreline and outflow consisting mostly of large boulders, making accurate physical measurement of outflow volumes extremely difficult using a control structure like a weir or flume. Due to underground seepage, estimates of lake outflow must be modelled. Lake 378 has a water level gauge to provide data for outflow models.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 378 Lake Level

In early July 2020, a staff gauge and Sutron Stage-Discharge Recorder were installed on Lake 378. The station consists of a metric gauge plate fastened to a board, anchored to a very large boulder, as well as an 8‚Äù PVC stilling well and SDR shelter mounted to the same boulder and an adjacent boulder. The staff gauge was installed to an original elevation of 9.798 m (top of gauge, A-37 p.63), relative to the benchmark installed on an adjacent boulder (# 70, assigned arbitrary elevation of 10.000 m). The station is located on the east shore of L378, about 15 m north of the dock. The Sutron SDR-0001-1 data logger is installed each spring and removed each fall, to obtain continuous record during the open-water season.

<u>Groundwater Seepage</u>

The presence of subsurface flow or groundwater seepage from ELA lakes has generally been assumed to not exist or, at least, be insignificant to the annual water budget. This is not likely the case for L378, however, as parts of the watershed, most of the shoreline, and the outflow consist primarily of jumbled boulders above and below water level. The length of outflow stream was investigated for a suitable location of a control structure; seepage was observed throughout, including through the road which crosses the tributary. No seepage estimates have been carried out.
