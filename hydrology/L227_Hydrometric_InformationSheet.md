Watershed area (ha): 34.4 ha based on 1972 mapping

XX.X ha based on 2017 DEM\*

\* The watershed area of Lake 227 determined from the 2017 DEM has yet to be ground-truthed.

<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 227 is located 4 kilometres northeast of the ELA field station. It is a small headwater lake (5.0 ha) that flows into Lake 305. The watershed is 34.4 ha including the lake surface. The best basin contour mapping available is that done by Lockwood Survey (1972) at a scale of 1:7920. A digital elevation map (DEM) was created from aerial imagery flown in 2017 as part of NWOOP.

Hydrological work consisted of monitoring lake level and lake outflow most years between 1969 and 1998 to obtain seven-month record between April and October. During the November to March winter period, record does not normally exist, but flows were usually zero or very low. Beaver activity in the later years was often a problem. Service of the two hydrometric stations, and computation of flows, was by WSC from 1969 to 1984 with the exception of 1974. In 1974 and all years after 1984, service, records and computations were carried out by ELA staff.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 227 Lake Level

Hydrological work began May 17, 1969 when Water Survey of Canada (WSC) installed a survey benchmark, stilling well and Stevens A-35 float water level recorder on the lake. The lake level gauge was operated in 1969, 1970, and 1977 to 1998. The record was discontinued at the end of the 1998 season.

2.  Lake 227 Outflow

October 27, 1970, a 90<sup>o</sup> v-notch sharp crested weir was constructed on the outflow stream by WSC. Data prior to this construction date was based on open channel measurements related to lake level. This first weir was a temporary plywood and plastic lined structure with stilling well and a Leupold and Stevens A-35 float water level recorder. The original weir was replaced in 1985 with a new 90<sup>o</sup> v-notch sharp crested concrete weir at the same location by ELA personnel. The concrete was not sealed. In winter, monthly streamflow observations were made since 1982. This station was discontinued at the end of the 1998 season.

<u>Clean-up</u>

In April 2014, the responsibility for ownership and operation of the ELA transferred from DFO to IISD. As part of that agreement, a major cleanup of many research sites was undertaken. Both the lake level and weir sites were removed during the 2015 field season. The survey benchmark remains at the former lake level gauge location.
