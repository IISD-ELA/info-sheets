<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 112 is a headwater lake with an approximate surface area of 8.6 ha and a total watershed area of about 54.8 ha. It is not a designated experimental lake, though is an important upstream lake for L260, a designated experimental lake. As with L260, the watershed of L112 consists mainly of large boulders, which makes measuring the hydrology of the lake very challenging. As there is seepage through the ground and the cracks and spaces between underground boulders, accurate physical measurement of outflow discharge to downstream L260 is all but impossible. The lake is contained by an ancient beaver dam which it apparently very rarely flows over or around. L112 is about 6.8 hectares in size, with a watershed area of approximately 58 hectares (according to ela watersheds revised 2003 document). New data from 2017 aerial photos or even earlier aerial photos may offer better estimate. Lake 112 has a maximum depth of 2.1 m. L112 is a 1<sup>st</sup> order lake with a ~ 550 m downstream channel which flows into L260.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 112 Lake Level.

In 2018, L112 was equipped with a Sutron SDR-0001-1 and stilling well with accompanying staff gauge. This station was installed to monitor lake level in order to estimate outflow discharge. The staff gauge was installed on a very large boulder on the west side of the lake, south of the outflow. The water level appeared to be at a mid-range when the staff gauge was installed, based on high-water marks. During the summer of 2018, the lake level dropped to at least 10 cm below the bottom of the staff gauge. There is no apparent or easily accessible location to install a deeper staff gauge or stilling well. As the level is used to estimate when water might flow through the outflow area, low-water readings are far less important than mid or high-water level data and so relocating the gauging station is not essential. During the summer of 2019, the lake level climbed to approximately 15 cm above the top of the staff gauge. A square was placed on top of the staff gauge to get accurate readings, and the SDR station is high enough to capture the water level change without impediment from float or counterweight. The high-water level from 2019 appears to be a new record based on previous water marks. Water was flowing over the beaver dam at the lake outlet, suggesting even higher water levels are unlikely. Flow over the beaver dam was determined to stop when the lake level was at or below 0.960 m on the gauge board.

The first manual reading from the L112 lake level occurred on May 31, 2018. The station was surveyed to a benchmark of arbitrary value of 10.000. The direct water level was 9.415 m when initially surveyed, with a gauge board reading of 0.509 m. The SDR will be deployed in spring and pulled for winter each year that L260 has active research on it. The data is continuous 10-minute data.

<u>Groundwater Seepage</u>

The presence of subsurface flow or groundwater seepage from ELA lakes has generally been assumed to not exist or, at least, be insignificant to the annual water budget. This is certainly not the case of L112 or downstream L260. The terrain in the watersheds of these lakes consists partly of large subterranean boulders and rocks, leading to leaky lake bottoms and outflows. As such, it is nearly impossible to get an accurate physical measurement of discharge, leading to a modeling approach being taken. The L112 water level data will be used in a model to estimate total contribution to L260. Further investigation and ground-truthing is required to determine the lake level at which flow to L260 stops altogether.

Seepage through or under the beaver dam was estimated in August 2019 once flow over the dam ceased. Average seepage rate was determined to be 0.703 L/s (0.0007 m<sup>3</sup>/s) using the bag method. This should be the maximum seepage at any water level, as the lake was at maximum capacity when the estimate was carried out. Data can be found in the HydroLim 112 hydrometric information sheet folder, in the file ‘L112SeepageQuantification_2019.xlsx’.
