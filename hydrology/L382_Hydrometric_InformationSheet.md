<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 382 is located approximately 6 km northeast of the ELA field station. L382 is a 36.9 hectare 1<sup>st</sup> order lake that flows northwest into L262 and onwards to Winnange Lake. The watershed of L382 is 203.3 hectares, based on 1976 aerial photographs. This lake is accessed by crossing two lakes (start at L468 (Roddy), then cross L305; portage from north end of L305). A small forest fire burned 15 ha (or 8%) of the watershed in June 1978.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 382 Outflow (WSC ID 05QD025)

Lake 382 had a gauged outflow between 1986 and 1997. A concrete weir equipped with a 120<sup>o</sup> v-notch and accompanying analog chart recorder were constructed in October 1986. The concrete weir was sealed with a tar foundation coat at the time of construction. The outflow area is bedrock controlled and the occurrence of subsurface seepage appears to be unlikely.

The hydrometric station was equipped with a Leupold and Stevens A-71 float water level recorder was operated during the open water season, while manual measurements were taken periodically in the winter months. In 1987, beaver caused problems by building their dams int eh V-notch. here beaver were accidentally trapped in fish nets that year. Days in which beaver activity affected flow have been assigned the qualifier code “D”.

A standard rain gauge was added in 1987 and was checked weekly during the open water season. Station was dismantled in 2015.

<u>History</u>

Early hydrological investigations were carried out jointly through an arrangement with the U of M and WSC, which included construction services, technical support, instrumentation and determination of mean daily discharge and mean daily lake level record as well as some financial support. The WSC continued to provide the loan of 22 water level recorders after 1985 until they became obsolete and were decommissioned.

The L382 outflow was managed by the WSC from 1987 to 1995 (data can be found here: <https://tinyurl.com/L382Q>). This outflow weir has since been dismantled and removed during the fall of 2015, as per the cleanup agreement between DFO and IISD upon the transfer of ELA.
