<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 260 is a second order lake that is located 4.5 km northwest of the ELA field station. It has a surface area of 33.23 ha and a total watershed area of 194.03 ha including the upstream Lake 112 tributary watershed (57.71 ha). Drainage areas are based on the topographical map produced by Lockwood Surveys (1972) at a scale of 1:7920 from aerial photos taken in 1969-70. Lake 260 flows north into Winnange Lake. Most of the L260 watershed, including L112 inflow stream and L260 outflow, consists of large boulders, making accurate determination of outflow volumes impossible using a control structure like a weir or flume. Due to underground seepage, estimates of lake outflow are modelled. Both L260 and upstream L112 have water level gauges to provide data for outflow models.

A forest fire in 1979 burned approximately 75% of L112 watershed, from the southwest side of the lake around to the northeast side. The same fire burned the south shoreline of L260. The combined area burned amounts to approximately 25% of the L260 watershed (an area of about 31 ha based on the OFAT watershed area).

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 260 Outflow - ungauged

Lake 260 outflow is actively controlled by beaver. An ancient beaver dams exist across two-thirds of the north end of the lake. Water exits the lake overtop of the dam and through small intermittent channels throughout the beaver dam. Three 10” PVC pipes were installed in 2018 to help regulate water levels during the FOReSt and BOREAL experiments. These pipes extend approximately 3 m out into the lake and 2 m downstream of the dam, with the top of the pipes at an average elevation of 9.243 m relative to the lake level benchmark (p.45 survey book A-37). These pipes were installed at an approximate slope of 0.05 (m/m). Pipes removed May 2024, due to the winding down of FOReSt and BOREAL experiments, and no longer needing to regulate water levels.

The best location to physically measure discharge from L260 is at a culvert at the Lake 660 trail, approximately 450 m downstream of the beaver dam at the north end of the lake. This location channels all flow from the upstream watershed through a single culvert, however there is some seepage through the road. The watershed area for this culvert is approximately 231 ha, based on the Ontario Flow Assessment Tool.

2.  Lake 260 Lake Level

In early May 2017, a staff gauge and Sutron Stage-Discharge Recorder were installed on Lake 260. The station consists of a metric gauge plate fastened to a board, anchored to a very large boulder (embedded in the shoreline), as well as an 8” PVC stilling well and SDR shelter mounted to the same boulder. The staff gauge was installed to an original elevation of 9.627 m (top of gauge, A-37 p.15), relative to the benchmark installed on an adjacent boulder (assigned arbitrary elevation of 10.000 m). The station is located on the south shore of L260, about 5 m east of the dock. The Sutron SDR-0001-1 data logger is installed each spring and removed each fall, to obtain continuous record during the open-water season.

<u>Groundwater Seepage</u>

The presence of subsurface flow or groundwater seepage from ELA lakes has generally been assumed to not exist or, at least, be insignificant to the annual water budget. This is likely not the case for L260, as the watershed, shoreline, lake outlet and outflowing stream consist primarily of jumbled boulders above and below water level. The best location for a control structure is a culvert at the end of a wetland downstream of the lake, however seepage has been observed through the road in which the culvert is embedded. No seepage estimates have been carried out.
