<u>Water Diversion Study</u>

Hydrological monitoring on Lake 627 began in 2008 as part of a study to look at the effects of reduced water input to a lake, including changes to the aquatic biology and chemistry, as well as changes in thermal regimes and evaporation. To accomplish this, the outflow of L627 into Lake 626 was dammed, and a diversion channel was blasted to direct water from L627 around L626. At the end of the study, the watershed will be returned to its former state, the diversion channel will be filled and the area restored.

<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 627 (Figure 1) is located on the west side of the Pine Road approximately 13 km south of Highway 17 and 17 km north of the ELA field station. The lake is road accessible.

Lake 627 is a small 35.5 ha, 3<sup>rd</sup> order lake having a total watershed area of approximately 303 ha. Historically, the lake flows out under Pine Rd. through a 61 cm diameter culvert. Currently, L627 flows through a channel blasted in bedrock on the southwest side of the lake. The stream then passes through a series of wetlands and drops totaling about 17 vertical metres over a distance of about 1 km before entering downstream Lake 625.

There are two upstream lakes tributary to Lake 627. Lakes 429 and 628 flow into Lake 627. Table 1 provides a summary of drainage areas for the watersheds of interest. The two tributary lake watersheds account for 92.7 percent of the total Lake 627 watershed area.

On November 23, 2010, the water diversion began by damming off the three lakes at the outlet of Lake 627 and diverting that water through a diversion channel (photographs 2 and 3) thereby bypassing Lake 626 and moving the flow directly to Lake 625.

Table 1. Drainage areas for the Lake 626 watershed.

| Lake | Lake Order | Aw (ha) | Ad (ha) | At (ha) | As (ha) |
|:----:|:----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 626  |     4      |  372.4  |  69.0   |  43.2   |  25.8   |
| 627  |     3      |  303.4  |  87.5   |  51.9   |  35.6   |
| 628  |     2      |  215.9  |  150.4  |  130.3  |  20.1   |
| 429  |     1      |  65.5   |  65.5   |  49.8   |  15.7   |

Where:

- Order is the number of lakes above the outflow.

- Aw is the total watershed area including all land and water surfaces and tributary areas.

- Ad is the watershed area including land and water surface but excluding tributary areas.

- At is the terrestrial area surrounding the lake including islands.

- As is the total water surface area of the lake excluding the island areas.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

There is one hydrometric station within the Lake 627 watershed; the recording lake level station. The outflow from Lake 627 has never been monitored.

1.  Lake 627 Lake Level:

On November 2, 2010, a staff gauge, stilling well and survey benchmark with an assigned arbitrary elevation (10.000 m) were installed on Lake 627. A wooden timber sill was also installed at the mouth of the channel at this time. Manual readings were taken approximately once per month during the open water season between 2008 and 2010. An OTT Thalimedes data logger was installed on April 7, 2011 to obtain continuous lake level record during the open-water season. The OTT Thalimedes was replaced with a Sutron SDR-0001-1 on 1 May 2021.
