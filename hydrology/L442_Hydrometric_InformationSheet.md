<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 442 is located directly off Pine Road, approximately 9.2 km from Highway 17. L442 is a small 16 hectare 2<sup>nd</sup> order lake with max and mean depths of 17.8 m and 9 m, respectively. L442 has one inflow at the north end and flows south into a wetland and eventually northwest into Geejay Lake (L653). The upstream lake, L438, is a slightly smaller lake that flows under Pine Rd approximately 0.5 km from L442. The watershed of L442 is approximately 161 hectares, based on 1985 mapping done by Airquest, using 1982 aerial photography. (McCullough and Campbell 1993).

During the November to March winter period, records do not exist. Beaver activity in some years has been a problem, causing lake levels to fluctuate drastically (~0.716 m). An extreme storm blew out the beaver dam between 8-10 June 2002.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 442 Lake Level

Hydrological work began September 9, 1986 with the install of a benchmark (red spray-painted arrow) and a manual reading. Manual readings were taken 1-2 times per month during the open water season in the years 1987 – 1996. Four manual readings were taken in 2000. In 2002, a permanent benchmark, stilling well, gauge board, and OTT Thalimedes logger were installed on July 24, 2002. The lake level gauge has been in operation every open-water season since then. The OTT Thalimedes was replaced with a Sutron SDR-0001-1 on 1 May 2021.

2.  Lake 442 Outflow

Lake 442 has never had a gauged outflow. This may change in the coming years. L442 has experienced a wide range of lake levels due to beaver activity at the outflow stream.

<u>History</u>

Studies began as part of the Natural Variability Program headed by Paul Campbell. Initial hydrology on L442 was carried out by Greg McCullough (GKM) outside of the regular ELA Hydrology Program (Beaty, Lyng). No water level data was collected in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001.

The first elevation reference (BM#58) was the tip of a red spray-painted arrow on bedrock face at south end of lake, and was set to an arbitrary of 10.000 m. Water level was taken by measuring down to the water’s surface from this point with a measuring tape, and subtracting that number from 10.000 m. The current benchmark (BM#58b) was established on September 11, 2002 (ref. A25 p43-44) and was established via water level transfer. The new benchmark elevation is 9.323 m.

A bathymetric survey was carried out by GKM and PC on August 29, 1989 (see G.K. McCullough and P. Campbell 1993 for methods). Bathymetric map created June 5, 1990 by GKM for WL of 8.945 m. Prior to June 2002, the lake was actively controlled at a higher level by a beaver. Since this date, the lake has largely remained at a lower level and fluctuated to a lesser extent. Bathymetry was sounded on 29 August 1989, when the lake was at a level of 8.945 m.

Bathymetric mapping has since been repeated and captured digitally by Lee Hrenchuk on July 6, 2018, when the lake was at a level of 8.644 m. The high-water mark for L442 is at an elevation of 9.250 m, relative to the benchmark.
