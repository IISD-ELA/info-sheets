Long Descriptions

A manual gauge observation: Indicates that the stated value is an estimate based on one or more readings or in combination with partial recorded record.

B ice conditions: Indicates that ice conditions above, below or in the control structure may have affected the quality of record. ‘B’ values should be considered as a best estimate only.

C flow capacity exceeded: The flow capacity was exceeded for all or part of the day reported resulting in a ‘best estimate only’.

D beaver: A beaver dam or debris within, below or above the monitoring structure affected the quality of flow data and should be considered to be ‘best estimates only’. *(The use of this code will cease and be replaced with either D1 or D2 codes effective January 2010. Previous data will be corrected accordingly as time allows. K. Beaty, January 28, 2010)*

D1 beaver: A beaver dam or debris within, below or above the monitoring structure affected the quality of flow data therefore reported values should be considered to be ‘best estimates only’.

D2 beaver dam: A beaver dam located above the monitoring structure was opened or removed resulting in a hydrograph that was not related to a storm event. The quality of record was not affected.

E estimated value: This indicates a value that was indirectly determined by interpolation, extrapolation, correlation with other stations, or by other means but in consideration of meteorological data.

F frozen station: This indicates a value that was missing or estimated due to freezing conditions.

H FLUDEX Effect: During the May to September period of years 1999 to 2003, seepage and end-of-season water release from FLUDEX Reservoir 2 added foreign water to the Lake 239 NW Subbasin.

I interpolated value: This indicates a value or string of values that were estimated by linear interpolation between observed values.

L leakage: This indicates that an adjustment has been made to monitored record to incorporate an estimate for leakage around or under a flow measuring structure.

M missing: This indicates a missing value or period of record for which estimates could not be reliably determined.

R regulated: This indicates record that was affected by regulation of flow or water level for intentional purposes. (e.g. impoundment, construction).

S affected by experiment: This indicates a value that represents an unnatural flow or water level result due to a research experiment (e.g. drawdown, siphon, irrigation).

U intentional flow release: This indicates that a reported value was the result of an intentional (unnatural) flow release where upstream water may have been held back for construction or research experiment reasons and later released.
