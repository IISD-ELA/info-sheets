<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 660 is located via a 2.3 km trail off Pine Road, approximately 20.5 km from Highway 17. L660 is a 2388 hectare, 142<sup>nd</sup> order lake, and is one of the larger lakes in the ELA region. The watershed of L660 is approximately 11489 hectares. Winnange is a complex lake, with an approximate maximum depth of 110 metres.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 660 Lake Level

Hydrological work began November 16, 1999 with the survey of high-water marks, ice scour lines, and water levels of L660 and L658. Manual surveys were taken ~1-2 times per month between June 2000 and 29 May 2003. All surveys were to a benchmark of arbitrary datum 10.000 m, near the outflow of L628 into L660. On June 5, 2003, a logger was installed to capture continuous water level data. The lake level gauge was decommissioned on October 27, 2011.

<u>History</u>

Studies began as part of the METAALICUS study. Initial hydrology on L660 was carried out by Ken Beaty, with additional instrumentation and hydrological data collected by USGS members involved with the study.

The first elevation reference (BM#55a) was a large spike in a 6‚Äù diameter jack pine, on the right side of the L658 outflow control structure and 6 m downstream. This benchmark was set to an arbitrary of 10.000 m. Initial water levels were surveyed in reference to this benchmark. Additional benchmarks were created at a later date in reference to this original benchmark.

A bathymetric survey was carried out by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.
