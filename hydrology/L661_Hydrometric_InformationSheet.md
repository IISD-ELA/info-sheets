<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 661 is located approximately 800 m west southwest of the ELA field station. L661 is a small 1.3 hectare 3<sup>rd</sup> order lake that flows southeast into L470 and beyond. The watershed of L661 is 125.4 hectares. Lake 661 has a maximum depth of 1 m. During the November to March winter period, discharge is interpolated or estimated based on monthly manual readings.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 661 Outflow (WSC ID 05PD028)

Lake 661 had a gauged outflow between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1997. A concrete weir equipped with a 120<sup>o</sup> v-notch and accompanying Stevens A-35 Analog Chart Recorder were operated during the open water season by the Water Survey of Canada between 1983 and the end of 1995. ELA staff collected and processed data between 1995 and 1997. The weir was in place but not operated or maintained between 1997 and 2015, when it was removed as part of the DFO cleanup.

<u>History</u>

Early hydrological investigations were carried out jointly through an arrangement with the U of M and WSC, which included construction services, technical support, instrumentation and determination of mean daily discharge and mean daily lake level record as well as some financial support. The WSC continued to provide the loan of 22 water level recorders after 1985 until they became obsolete and were decommissioned.

The L661 outflow was managed by the WSC for most years. Publicly available data can be found here: <https://tinyurl.com/y6uq2uuv>).
