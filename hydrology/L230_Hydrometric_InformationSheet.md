Watershed area (ha): 8.89 ha based on 1976 mapping

XX.X ha based on 2017 DEM\*

\* The watershed area of Lake 230 determined from the 2017 DEM has yet to be ground-truthed.

<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 230 is located 7 kilometres east of the ELA field station. It is a small headwater lake (1.67 ha) that flows into Lake 310. The watershed is 8.89 ha including the lake surface. This area was based on 1976 air photo interpretation as no suitable contour mapping currently exists for this location.

Hydrometric work on Lake 230 was carried out in the years 1971 to 1980 when Water Survey of Canada operated an outflow weir to obtain seven-month record between April and October. During the November to March winter period, record does not normally exist, but flows were usually zero or very low. Service of the hydrometric station, and computation of flows, was by WSC in all years with the exception of 1974.

The entire Lake 230 watershed was affected by a severe windstorm on July 7, 1973. One year later, on June 26, 1974 the entire basin was burned by forest fire. The effects of the wind storm and forest fire have been described by Schindler et al. (1980).

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 230 Outflow

November 18, 1970, a 60<sup>o</sup> v-notch sharp crested weir was constructed on the outflow stream by WSC. This was a temporary plywood and plastic lined structure with a stilling well and a Leupold and Stevens A-35 float water level recorder. Record was collected for the seven-month period from April to the end of October. No data exists for the November to early April winter periods, but flows were normally zero to very low. This station was discontinued at the end of the 1980 season.

<u>Clean-up</u>

In April 2014, the responsibility for ownership and operation of the ELA transferred from DFO to IISD. As part of that agreement, a major cleanup of many research sites was undertaken. The remains of the weir and other debris were removed during the 2015 field season.
