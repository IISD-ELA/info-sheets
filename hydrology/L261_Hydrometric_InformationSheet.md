Watershed area (ha): 47.58 ha based on 1976 mapping

XX.X ha based on 2017 DEM\*

\* The watershed area of Lake 261 determined from the 2017 DEM has yet to be ground-truthed.

<u>The Watershed</u>

Lake 261 is located 6.1 kilometres north of the ELA field station. It is a small headwater lake (5.57 ha) that flows into Lake 262. The watershed area is 47.58 ha including the lake surface. This area was based on 1976 air photo interpretation as no suitable contour mapping currently exists for this location.

The Lake 261 watershed was not affected by any of the major forest fires that have touched or damaged some ELA study lakes.

<u>Hydrometric Stations</u>

1.  Lake 261 Outflow

Hydrometric work on Lake 261 was carried out in the years 1971 to 1980 when Water Survey of Canada operated an outflow weir to obtain seven-month record between April and October each year. A 60<sup>o</sup> v-notch sharp crested weir was constructed on the outflow stream by WSC on October 27, 1970. This was a temporary plywood and plastic lined structure with a stilling well and a Leupold and Stevens A-35 float water level recorder. During the November to March winter period, record does not normally exist, but flows were assumed to be zero or very low. Service of the hydrometric station, and computation of flows, was by WSC in all years with the exception of 1974 when ELA staff operated the station. Hydrometric monitoring was discontinued at the end of the 1980 season.

<u>Clean-up</u>

In April 2014, the responsibility for ownership and operation of the ELA transferred from DFO to IISD. As part of that agreement, a major cleanup of many research sites was undertaken. The remains of the weir and other debris were removed during the 2015 field season.
